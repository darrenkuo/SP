1.  What is the type of the value of <tt>(delay (+ 1 27))?</tt> 
What is the type of the value of <tt>(force (delay (+ 1 27)))?</tt> 

<p>
<br /><br />2.  Evaluation of the expression

<p>
<tt>  <pre>(stream-cdr (stream-cdr (cons-stream 1 '(2 3))))

</pre></tt>

<p>
 produces an error.  Why?

<p>
<br /><br />3.  Consider the following two procedures.

<p>
<tt>  <pre>(define (enumerate-interval low high)
  (if (&#62; low high)
    '()
    (cons low (enumerate-interval (+ low 1) high)) ) )

(define (stream-enumerate-interval low high)
  (if (&#62; low high)
    the-empty-stream
    (cons-stream low (stream-enumerate-interval (+ low 1) high)) ) )

</pre></tt>

<p>
What's the difference between the following two expressions?

<p>
<tt>  <pre>(delay (enumerate-interval 1 3))
(stream-enumerate-interval&nbsp;1&nbsp;3)

</pre></tt>

<p>
<br /><br />4.  An unsolved problem in number theory concerns the following algorithm
for creating a sequence of positive integers s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ...

<p>
<br />by 4em<pre>Choose s<sub>1</sub> to be some positive integer.
For n  &gt;  1,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    if s<sub>n</sub> is odd, then s<sub>n+1</sub> is 3 s<sub>n</sub> + 1;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    if s<sub>n</sub> is even, then s<sub>n+1</sub> is s<sub>n</sub> / 2.

</pre>

<p>
No matter what starting value is chosen, the sequence always
seems to end with the values 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ...
However, it is not known if this is always the case.

<p>
4a.  Write a procedure <tt>num-seq</tt> that, given a positive integer <tt>n</tt>
as argument, returns the stream of values produced for <tt>n</tt>
by the algorithm just given.  For example, <tt>(num-seq 7)</tt> should return
the stream representing the sequence 
7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ...

<p>
4b.  Write a procedure <tt>seq-length</tt> that, given a stream produced
by <tt>num-seq</tt>, returns the number of values that occur in the sequence
up to and including the first 1.
For example, <tt>(seq-length (num-seq 7))</tt> should return 17.
You should assume that there is a 1 somewhere in the sequence.
