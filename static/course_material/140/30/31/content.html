<P><A NAME="g6"></A> You can understand variables in terms of the
little-people model.  A variable, in this model, is the association in the
little person's mind between a formal parameter (name) and the actual
argument (value) she was given.  When we want to know <CODE>(square 5)</CODE>, we
hire Srini and tell him his argument is 5.  Srini therefore substitutes 5
for <CODE>x</CODE> in the body of <CODE>square</CODE>.  Later, when we want to know the
square of 6, we hire Samantha and tell her that her argument is 6.  Srini and
Samantha have two different variables, both named <CODE>x</CODE>.

<P>Srini and Samantha do their work separately, one after the other.  But
in a more complicated example, there could even be more than
one value called <CODE>x</CODE> at the same time:
 
<P><PRE>(define (square x) (* x x))
 
(define (<A NAME="g7"></A>hypotenuse x y)
  (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y))))
 
&gt; (hypotenuse 3 4)
5
</PRE> 
 
<P>Consider the situation when we've hired Hortense to evaluate that
expression.  Hortense associates the name <CODE>x</CODE> with the value 3 (and also
the name <CODE>y</CODE> with the value 4, but we're going to pay attention to <CODE>x</CODE>).  She has to compute two <CODE>square</CODE>s.  She hires Solomon to compute
<CODE>(square 3)</CODE>.  Solomon associates the name <CODE>x</CODE> with the value 3.
This happens to be the same as Hortense's value, but it's still a separate
variable that could have had a different value&mdash;as we see when Hortense
hires Sheba to compute <CODE>(square 4)</CODE>.  Now, simultaneously, Hortense
thinks <CODE>x</CODE> is 3 and Sheba thinks <CODE>x</CODE> is 4.

<P>(Remember that we said a variable is a connection between a name and a
value.  So <CODE>x</CODE> isn't a variable!  The association of the name <CODE>x</CODE> 
with the value 5 is a variable.  The reason we're being so fussy about this
terminology is that it helps clarify the case in which several variables
have the same name.  But in practice people are generally sloppy about this
fine point; we can usually get away with saying &quot;<CODE>x</CODE> is a variable&quot;
when we mean &quot;there is some variable whose name is <CODE>x</CODE>.&quot;)
 
<P>Another important point about the way little people do variables is that
they can't read each others' minds.  In particular, they don't know about
the values of the local variables that belong to the little people who
hired them.  For example, the following attempt to compute the value 10
won't work:
 
<P><PRE>(define (f x)
  (g 6))
 
(define (g y)
  (+ x y))
 
&gt; (f 4)
ERROR - VARIABLE X IS UNBOUND.
</PRE> 
 
<P>We hire Franz to compute <CODE>(f 4)</CODE>.  He associates <CODE>x</CODE> with
4 and evaluates <CODE>(g 6)</CODE> by hiring Gloria.  Gloria associates <CODE>y</CODE> 
with 6, but she doesn't have any value for <CODE>x</CODE>, so she's in trouble.
The solution is for Franz to tell Gloria that <CODE>x</CODE> is <CODE>4</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(define (f x)
  (g x 6))
 
(define (g x y)
  (+ x y))
 
&gt; (f 4)
10
</PRE>
