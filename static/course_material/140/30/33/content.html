<P>We said earlier in a footnote that Scheme doesn't actually do all the
copying and substituting we've been talking about.  What actually happens is
<A NAME="g12"></A> 
more like our model of global variables, in which there is a chalkboard
somewhere that associates names with values&mdash;except that instead of making
a new copy of every expression with values substituted for names, Scheme
works with the original expression and looks up the value for each
name at the moment when that value is needed.  To make local variables work,
there are several chalkboards: a global one and one for each little person.
 
<P>The fully detailed model of variables using several chalkboards is what many
people find hardest about learning Scheme.  That's why we've chosen to use
the simpler substitution model.
