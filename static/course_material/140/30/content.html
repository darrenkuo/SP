<P>A <EM>variable</EM> is a connection between a name and a
<A NAME="g1"></A> value. That sounds simple enough, but some complexities arise in practice.  To avoid confusion later, we'll spend some time now looking at the idea of &quot;variable&quot; in more detail.
 
<P>The name <EM>variable</EM> comes from algebra.  Many people are introduced to
variables in high school algebra classes, where the emphasis is on solving
equations.  &quot;If <EM>x</EM><SUP>3</SUP>&minus;8=0, what is the value of <EM>x</EM>?&quot; In
problems like these, although we call <EM>x</EM> a variable, it's really a <EM><A NAME="g2"></A><A NAME="g3"></A>named constant!</EM> In this particular problem, <EM>x</EM> has the
value 2.  In any such problem, at first we don't know the value of <EM>x</EM>, but
we understand that it does have some particular value, and that value isn't
going to change in the middle of the problem.
 
<P>In functional programming, what we mean by &quot;variable&quot; is like a named
constant in mathematics.  Since a variable is the connection between a name
and a value, a formal parameter in a procedure definition isn't a variable;
it's just a name.  But when we invoke the procedure with a particular
argument, that name is associated with a value, and a variable is created.
If we invoke the procedure again, a <EM>new</EM> variable is created, perhaps
with a different value.
 
<P>There are two possible sources of confusion about this.  One is that you may
have programmed before in a programming language like BASIC or Pascal, in
which a variable often <EM>does</EM> get a new value, even after it's already
had a previous value assigned to it.  Programs in those languages tend to be
full of things like &quot;<CODE>X = X + 1</CODE>.&quot; Back in Chapter 2 we told
you that this book is about something called
&quot;<A NAME="g4"></A><A NAME="g5"></A>functional programming,&quot; but we haven't yet explained exactly
what that means.  (Of course we <EM>have</EM> introduced a lot of functions,
and that is an important part of it.)  Part of what we mean by functional
programming is that once a variable exists, we aren't going to <EM>change</EM> the value of that variable.  
 
<P>The other possible source of confusion is that in Scheme, unlike the
situation in algebra, we may have more than one variable with the same name
at the same time.  That's because we may invoke one procedure, and the body
of that procedure may invoke another procedure, and each of them might use the
same formal parameter name.  There might be one variable named <CODE>x</CODE> with
the value 7, and another variable named <CODE>x</CODE> with the value 51, at the
same time.  The pitfall to avoid is thinking &quot;<CODE>x</CODE> has changed its value
from 7 to 51.&quot;
 
<P>As an analogy, imagine that you are at a party along with Mick Jagger, Mick
Wilson, Mick Avory, and Mick Dolenz.  If you're having a conversation with
one of them, the name &quot;Mick&quot; means a particular person to you.  If you
notice someone else talking with a different Mick, you wouldn't think &quot;Mick
has become a different person.&quot; Instead, you'd think &quot;there are several
people here all with the name Mick.&quot;
