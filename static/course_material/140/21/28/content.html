<P>Suppose we want to write a <CODE>greet</CODE> procedure that works like this:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (greet '(brian epstein))
(PLEASED TO MEET YOU BRIAN - HOW ARE YOU?)
 
&gt; (greet '(professor donald knuth))
(PLEASED TO MEET YOU PROFESSOR KNUTH - HOW ARE YOU?)
</PRE> 
 
<P>The response of the program in these two cases is almost the same;
the only difference is in the form of the person's name.
 
<P>This procedure could be written in two ways:
 
<P><PRE>(define (greet name)
  (if (equal? (first name) 'professor)
      (se '(pleased to meet you)
      'professor
      (last name)
      '(- how are you?))
      (se '(pleased to meet you)
      (first name)
      '(- how are you?))))
 
(define (greet name)
  (se '(pleased to meet you)
      (if (equal? (first name) 'professor)
      (se 'professor (last name))
      (first name))
      '(- how are you?)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>The second version avoids repeating the common parts of the
response by using <CODE>if</CODE> within a larger expression.
 
<P>Some people find it counterintuitive to use <CODE>if</CODE> as we did in the second
version.  Perhaps the reason is that in some other programming languages,
<CODE>if</CODE> is a &quot;command&quot; instead of a function like any other.  A mechanism
that selects one part of a program to run, and leaves out another part, may
seem too important to be a mere argument subexpression.  But in Scheme, the
value returned by <EM>every</EM> function can be used as part of a larger
expression.
 
<P>We aren't saying anything new here.  We've already explained the idea of
composition of functions, and we're just making the same point again about
<CODE>if</CODE>.  But we've learned that many students expect <CODE>if</CODE> to be an
exception, so we're taking the opportunity to emphasize the point: There are
no exceptions to this rule.
