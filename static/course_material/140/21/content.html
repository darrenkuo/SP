<P>We still need one more thing before we can write more interesting programs: 
the ability to make decisions.  Scheme has a way to say &quot;if this is true,
then do this thing, otherwise do something else.&quot;
 
<P>Here's a procedure that greets a person:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g63"></A>greet name)
  (if (equal? (first name) 'professor)
      (se '(i hope i am not bothering you) 'professor (last name))
      (se '(good to see you) (first name))))
 
&gt; (greet '(matt wright))
(GOOD TO SEE YOU MATT)
 
&gt; (greet '(professor harold abelson))
(I HOPE I AM NOT BOTHERING YOU PROFESSOR ABELSON)
</PRE> 
 
<P>The program greets a person by checking to see if that person is a
professor.  If so, it says, &quot;I hope I am not bothering you&quot; and then the
professor's name.  But if it's a regular person, the program just says,
&quot;Good to see you,&quot; and then the person's first name.
 
<P><CODE>If</CODE> takes three arguments.  The first has to be either true or
false.
<A NAME="spif"></A> 
<A NAME="g64"></A> 
(We'll talk in a moment about exactly what true and false look like to
Scheme.)  In the above example, the first word of the person's name might or
might not be equal to the word &quot;Professor.&quot; The second and third arguments
are expressions; one or the other of them is evaluated depending on the
first argument.  The value of the entire <CODE>if</CODE> expression is the value of
either the second or the third argument.
 
<P> 
You learned in Chapter 2 that Scheme includes a special data type
called <EM>Booleans</EM> to represent true or false
values.  There are just two of them: <A NAME="g65"></A><CODE>#t</CODE> for &quot;true&quot; and
<A NAME="g66"></A><CODE>#f</CODE> for &quot;false.&quot;<A NAME="dumbfalse"></A>
 
<P>We said that the first argument to <CODE>if</CODE> has to be true or false.  Of
course, it would be silly to say
 
<P> 
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (if #t (+ 4 5) (* 2 7))
9
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
because what's the point of using <CODE>if</CODE> if we already know
which branch will be followed?  Instead, as in the <CODE>greet</CODE> example, we call
some procedure whose return value will be either true or false, depending on
the particular arguments we give it.
