<P>There are a few subtleties that we haven't told you about yet.  First of
all, <A NAME="g90"></A><CODE>if</CODE> is a <A NAME="g91"></A><A NAME="g92"></A>special form.  Remember that we're going to
need the value of only one of its last two arguments.  It would be wasteful
for Scheme to evaluate the other one.  So if you say
 
<P><PRE>(if (= 3 3)
    'sure
    (factorial 1000))
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>if</CODE> won't compute the factorial of 1000 before returning
<CODE>sure</CODE>.
 
<P>The rule is that <CODE>if</CODE> always evaluates its first argument.  If the value
of that argument is true, then <CODE>if</CODE> evaluates its second argument and
returns its value.  If the value of the first argument is false, then <CODE>if</CODE> evaluates its third argument and returns that value.
