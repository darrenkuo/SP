<P><CODE>If</CODE> is great for an either-or choice.  But sometimes there are several
possibilities to consider:
 
<P><PRE>(define (roman-value letter)
  (if (equal? letter 'i)
      1
      (if (equal? letter 'v)
          5
          (if (equal? letter 'x)
              10
              (if (equal? letter 'l)
                  50
                  (if (equal? letter 'c)
                      100
                      (if (equal? letter 'd)
                          500
                          (if (equal? letter 'm)
                              1000
                              'huh?))))))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>That's pretty hideous.  Scheme provides a shorthand notation for
situations like this in which you have to choose from among several
possibilities: the <A NAME="g99"></A><A NAME="g100"></A>special form <A NAME="g101"></A><CODE>cond</CODE>.
<A NAME="cond"></A> 
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g102"></A>roman-value letter)
  (cond ((equal? letter 'i) 1)
        ((equal? letter 'v) 5)
        ((equal? letter 'x) 10)
        ((equal? letter 'l) 50)
        ((equal? letter 'c) 100)
        ((equal? letter 'd) 500)
        ((equal? letter 'm) 1000)
        (else 'huh?)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>The tricky thing about <CODE>cond</CODE> is that it doesn't use parentheses in quite
<A NAME="g103"></A> the same way as the rest
of Scheme.  Ordinarily, parentheses mean procedure invocation.  In <CODE>cond</CODE>, <EM>most</EM> of the parentheses still mean that, but <EM>some</EM> of
them are used to group pairs of tests and results.  We've reproduced the
same <CODE>cond</CODE> expression below, indicating the funny ones in boldface.
 
<P><PRE>(define (roman-value letter)
  (cond <STRONG><BIG>(</BIG></STRONG>(equal? letter 'i) 1<STRONG><BIG>)</BIG></STRONG> 
        <STRONG><BIG>(</BIG></STRONG>(equal? letter 'v) 5<STRONG><BIG>)</BIG></STRONG> 
        <STRONG><BIG>(</BIG></STRONG>(equal? letter 'x) 10<STRONG><BIG>)</BIG></STRONG> 
        <STRONG><BIG>(</BIG></STRONG>(equal? letter 'l) 50<STRONG><BIG>)</BIG></STRONG> 
        <STRONG><BIG>(</BIG></STRONG>(equal? letter 'c) 100<STRONG><BIG>)</BIG></STRONG> 
        <STRONG><BIG>(</BIG></STRONG>(equal? letter 'd) 500<STRONG><BIG>)</BIG></STRONG> 
        <STRONG><BIG>(</BIG></STRONG>(equal? letter 'm) 1000<STRONG><BIG>)</BIG></STRONG> 
        <STRONG><BIG>(</BIG></STRONG>else 'huh?<STRONG><BIG>)</BIG></STRONG> ))
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>Cond</CODE> takes any number of arguments, each of which is <EM>two
expressions</EM> inside a pair of parentheses.  Each argument is called a <EM><A NAME="g104"></A><A NAME="g105"></A>cond clause.</EM> In the example above, one typical clause is
 
<P><PRE><STRONG><BIG>(</BIG></STRONG>(equal? letter 'l) 50<STRONG><BIG>)</BIG></STRONG> 
</PRE> 
 
<P>The outermost parentheses on that line enclose two expressions.
The first of the two expressions (the <EM>condition</EM>) is taken as
true or false, just like the first argument to <CODE>if</CODE>.  The second
expression of each pair (the <EM>consequent</EM>) is a candidate for
the return value of the entire <CODE>cond</CODE> invocation.
 
<P><CODE>Cond</CODE> examines its arguments from left to right.  Remember that since
<CODE>cond</CODE> is a special form, its arguments are not evaluated ahead of time.
For each argument, <CODE>cond</CODE> evaluates the first of the two expressions
within the argument.  If that value turns out to be true, then <CODE>cond</CODE> 
evaluates the second expression in the same argument, and returns that value
without examining any further arguments.  But if the value is false, then
<CODE>cond</CODE> does <EM>not</EM> evaluate the second expression; instead, it goes
on to the next argument.
 
<P>By convention, the last argument always starts with the word <A NAME="g106"></A><CODE>else</CODE> 
instead of an expression.  You can think of this as representing a true
value, but <CODE>else</CODE> doesn't mean true in any other context; you're only
allowed to use it as the condition of the last clause of a <CODE>cond</CODE>.

<P><small><small>What if you don't use an <CODE>else</CODE> clause at all?  If
none of the clauses has a true condition, then the return value is
unspecified.  In other words, always use <CODE>else</CODE>.</small></small>

<P>Don't get into bad habits of thinking about the appearance of
<CODE>cond</CODE> clauses in terms of &quot;two parentheses in a row.&quot;
That's often the case, but not always.  For example, here is a procedure that
translates Scheme true or false values (<CODE>#t</CODE> and <CODE>#f</CODE>)
into more human-readable words <CODE>true</CODE> and <CODE>false</CODE>.

<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g107"></A>truefalse value)
  (cond (value 'true)
        (else 'false)))

&gt; (truefalse (= 2 (+ 1 1)))
TRUE

&gt; (truefalse (= 5 (+ 2 2)))
FALSE
</PRE>

<P>When a <CODE>cond</CODE> tests several possible conditions, they might not
be <A NAME="g108"></A><A NAME="g109"></A>mutually exclusive.<sup>*</sup>
This can be either a source of error or an advantage in
writing efficient programs.  The trick is to make the <EM>most
restrictive</EM> test first.  For example, it would be an error to say

<P><PRE>(cond ((number? (first sent)) &hellip)           ;; wrong
      ((empty? sent) &hellip)
      &hellip)
</PRE>

<P>because the first test only makes sense once you've already
established that there <EM>is</EM> a first word of the sentence.
On the other hand, you don't have to say

<P><PRE>(cond ((empty? sent) &hellip)
      ((and (not (empty? sent)) (number? (first sent))) &hellip)
      &hellip)
</PRE>

<P>because you've already established that the sentence is nonempty
if you get as far as the second clause.

<P><small><small><sup>*</sup> Conditions are <em>mutually exclusive</em>
if only one of them can be true at a time.</small></small>
