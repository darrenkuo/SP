<P>Here's a procedure that returns the absolute value of a number:
 
<P> 
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g82"></A>abs num)
  (if (&lt; num 0)
      (- num)
      num))
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
 
<P>(If you call <A NAME="g83"></A><CODE>-</CODE> with just one argument, it returns the
negative of that argument.)  Scheme actually provides <A NAME="g84"></A><CODE>abs</CODE> as a
primitive procedure, but we can redefine it.
 
<P>Do you remember how to play buzz?  You're all sitting around the campfire
and you go around the circle counting up from one.  Each person says a
number.  If your number is divisible by seven or if one of its digits is a
seven, then instead of calling out your number, you say &quot;buzz.&quot;
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g85"></A>buzz num)
  (if (or (divisible? num 7) (member? 7 num))
      'buzz
      num))
 
(define (<A NAME="g86"></A>divisible? big little)
  (= (remainder big little) 0))
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>Or</CODE> can take any number of arguments, each of which must be
true or false.  It returns true if any of its arguments are true, that is, if
the first argument is true <EM>or</EM> the second argument is true <EM>or</EM>&hellip  (<CODE>Remainder</CODE>, as you know, takes two integers and tells
you what the remainder is when you divide the first by the second.  If the
remainder is zero, the first number is divisible by the second.)
 
<P><CODE>Or</CODE> is one of three functions in Scheme that combine true or false
values to produce another true or false value.  <CODE>And</CODE> returns true if
<A NAME="g87"></A> all of its arguments are true, that is, the first <EM>and</EM> 
second <EM>and</EM>&hellip  Finally, there's a function <A NAME="g88"></A><CODE>not</CODE> that
takes exactly one argument, returning true if that argument is false and
vice versa.
 
<P>In the last example, the procedure we really wanted to write was <CODE>buzz</CODE>,
but we found it useful to define <CODE>divisible?</CODE> also.  It's quite common
that the easiest way to solve some problem is to write a <EM>helper
procedure</EM> to do part of the work.  In this case the helper procedure
computes a function that's meaningful in itself, but sometimes you'll want
to write procedures with names like <CODE>buzz-helper</CODE> that are useful only
in the context of one particular problem.
 
<P>Let's write a program that takes a word as its argument and returns the
plural of that word.  Our first version will just put an &quot;s&quot; on the end:
 
<P><PRE>(define (plural wd)
  (word wd 's))
 
&gt; (plural 'beatle) 
BEATLES
 
&gt; (plural 'computer)
COMPUTERS
 
&gt; (plural 'fly)
FLYS
</PRE> 
 
<P>This works for most words, but not those that end in &quot;y.&quot; Here's
version two:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g89"></A>plural wd)
  (if (equal? (last wd) 'y)
      (word (bl wd) 'ies)
      (word wd 's)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>This isn't exactly right either; it thinks that the plural of
&quot;boy&quot; is &quot;boies.&quot;
