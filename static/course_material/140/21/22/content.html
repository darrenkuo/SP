<P>A function that returns either <CODE>#t</CODE> or <CODE>#f</CODE> is called a <EM>predicate.</EM> You've
already seen the <A NAME="g69"></A><CODE>equal?</CODE> predicate.  It takes two arguments, which
can be of any type, and returns <CODE>#t</CODE> if the two arguments are the same
value, or <CODE>#f</CODE> if they're different.  It's a convention in Scheme that
the names of predicates end with a question mark, but that's just a
convention.  Here are some other useful predicates:
 
<P> 
<PRE>&gt; (member? 'mick '(dave dee dozy beaky mick and tich))
#T
&gt; (member? 'mick '(john paul george ringo))
#F
&gt; (member? 'e 'truly)
#F
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
<PRE>&gt; (member? 'y 'truly)
#T
&gt; (= 3 4)
#F
&gt; (= 67 67)
#T
&gt; (&gt; 98 97)
#T
&gt; (before? 'zorn 'coleman)
#F
&gt; (before? 'pete 'ringo)
#T
&gt; (empty? '(abbey road))
#F
&gt; (empty? '())
#T
&gt; (empty? 'hi)
#F
&gt; (empty? (bf (bf 'hi)))
#T
&gt; (empty? &quot;&quot;)
#T
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
 
<P><CODE>Member?</CODE> takes two arguments; it checks to see if the first
<A NAME="memq"></A> 
<A NAME="g70"></A> 
one is a member of the second.  The <A NAME="g71"></A><CODE>=</CODE>, <A NAME="g72"></A><CODE>&gt;</CODE>, <A NAME="g73"></A><CODE>&lt;</CODE>,
<A NAME="g74"></A><CODE>&gt;=</CODE>, and <A NAME="g75"></A><CODE>&lt;=</CODE> functions take two numbers as arguments and do the
obvious comparisons.  (By the way, these are exceptions to the convention about
question marks.)  <CODE>Before?</CODE> is like <CODE>&lt;</CODE>, but it compares two words
<A NAME="g76"></A> 
alphabetically.  <CODE>Empty?</CODE> checks to see if its argument
<A NAME="g77"></A> 
is either the empty word or the empty sentence.
 
<P> 
 
<P>Why do we have both <CODE>equal?</CODE> and <CODE>=</CODE> in Scheme?  The first of these
works on any kind of Scheme data, while the second is defined only for
numbers.  You could get away with always using <CODE>equal?</CODE>, but the more
specific form makes your program more self-explanatory; people reading the
program know right away that you're comparing numbers.
 
<P> 
 
<P>There are also several predicates that can be used to test the type of their
argument:
 
<P> 
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (<A NAME="g78"></A>number? 'three)
#F
&gt; (number? 74)
#T
&gt; (<A NAME="g79"></A>boolean? #f)
#T
&gt; (boolean? '(the beatles))
#F
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
<PRE>&gt; (boolean? 234)
#F
&gt; (boolean? #t)
#T
&gt; (<A NAME="g80"></A>word? 'flying)
#T
&gt; (word? '(dig it))
#F
&gt; (word? 87)
#T
&gt; (<A NAME="g81"></A>sentence? 'wait)
#F
&gt; (sentence? '(what goes on))
#T
</PRE> 
 
<P>Of course, we can also define new predicates:
 
<P> 
 
<P><PRE>(define (vowel? letter)
  (member? letter 'aeiou))
 
(define (positive? number)
  (&gt; number 0))
</PRE>
