<P>The biggest pitfall in this chapter is the unusual notation of <CODE>cond</CODE>.  Keeping track of the parentheses that mean function invocation, as
usual, and the parentheses that just group the parts of a <CODE>cond</CODE> clause
is tricky until you get accustomed to it.
 
<P>Many people also have trouble with the asymmetry of the <A NAME="g110"></A><CODE>member?</CODE> 
predicate.  The first argument is something small; the second is something
big.  (The order of arguments is the same as the order of a typical English
sentence about membership:  &quot;Is Mick a member of the Beatles?&quot;)
It seems pretty obvious when you look at an example in which both
arguments are quoted constant values, but you can get in trouble when you
define a procedure and use its parameters as the arguments to <CODE>member?</CODE>.
Compare writing a procedure that says, &quot;does the letter E appear in this
word?&quot; with one that says, &quot;is this letter a vowel?&quot;
 
<P>Many people try to use <CODE>and</CODE> and <CODE>or</CODE> with the full flexibility
of the corresponding English words.  Alas, Scheme is not English.  For
example, suppose you want to know whether the argument to a procedure is
either the word <CODE>yes</CODE> or the word <CODE>no</CODE>.  You can't say
 
<P> 
<PRE>(equal? argument (or 'yes 'no))              ; wrong!
</PRE> 
 
<P>This sounds promising:  &quot;Is the <CODE>argument</CODE> <CODE>equal</CODE> to
the word <CODE>yes</CODE> <CODE>or</CODE> the word <CODE>no</CODE>?&quot; But the arguments to <CODE>or</CODE> must be true-or-false values, not things you want to check for equality
with something else.  You have to make two separate equality tests:
 
<P><PRE>(or (equal? argument 'yes) (equal? argument 'no))
</PRE> 
 
<P>In this particular case, you could also solve the problem by saying
 
<P><PRE>(member? argument '(yes no))
</PRE> 
 
<P>but the question of trying to use <CODE>or</CODE> as if it were English
comes up in other cases for which <CODE>member?</CODE> won't help.
 
<P>This isn't exactly a pitfall, because it won't stop your program from
working, but programs like
 
<P><PRE>(define (odd? n)
  (if (not (even? n)) #t #f))
</PRE> 
 
<P>are redundant.  Instead, you could just say
 
<P><PRE>(define (odd? n)
  (not (even? n)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>since the value of <CODE>(not (even? n))</CODE> is already <CODE>#t</CODE> or
<CODE>#f</CODE>.
