<P>Let's look again at the way we developed the <CODE>letter-pairs</CODE> procedure in
the last chapter.  We went through several steps:
 
<P><P><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">We wrote specific versions for zero-, one-, two-, and three-letter words.
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">We wrote <CODE>letter-pairs4</CODE>, decided it was too complicated, and looked
for a way to use <CODE>letter-pairs3</CODE> to help.
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">Having rewritten <CODE>letter-pairs4</CODE>, we tried to write <CODE>letter-pairs5</CODE> using the same pattern.  Since it didn't quite work, we
revised the pattern.
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">We generalized the pattern to write an unnumbered, recursive <CODE>letter-pairs</CODE>.
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">We checked to make sure that the recursive pattern would work for
two-letter and three-letter words.
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">Since the pattern doesn't work for zero- or one-letter words, we made
those the base cases.
 
</TABLE> 
<P> 
Although we needed the lowest numbered procedures in order to make
the entire collection of numbered procedures work, those low-numbered ones
didn't contribute to the critical step of finding a generalizable pattern.
Once you understand the idea of recursion, writing the individual procedures
is wasted effort.
 
<P>In the leap of faith method, we short-circuit this process in two ways.
First, we don't bother thinking about small examples; we begin with, for
example, a seven-letter word.  Second, we don't use our example to write a
particular numbered procedure; we write the recursive version directly.
