<P>In the combining method, we build up to a recursive procedure by writing a
number of special-case nonrecursive procedures, starting with small arguments
and working toward larger ones.  We find a generalizable way to use a
smaller version in writing a larger one.  As a result, all our procedures
end up looking nearly the same, so we combine them into one procedure.  
 
<P>The combining method is a good way to begin thinking about recursion because
each step of a solution is clearly justified by earlier steps.  The sequence
of events by which we get from a problem statement to a Scheme procedure is
clear and straightforward.  The disadvantage of the combining method,
though, is that it involves a lot of drudgery, not all of which really helps
toward the ultimate solution.  In this chapter we're going to develop a new
method called <EM>the leap of faith</EM> that overcomes this difficulty.
