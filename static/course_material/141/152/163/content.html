<P>One possible pitfall is a recursive case that doesn't make progress,
that is, one that doesn't reduce the size of the problem in the recursive call.
For example, let's say we're trying to write the procedure <CODE>down</CODE> that
works this way:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (down 'town)
(TOWN TOW TO T)
</PRE> 
 
<P>Here's an incorrect attempt:
 
<P><PRE>(define (down wd)                            ;; wrong!
  (if (empty? wd)
      '()
      (se wd (down (first wd)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>The recursive call looks as if it reduces the size of the problem,
but try it with an actual example.  What's <CODE>first</CODE> of the word <CODE>splat</CODE>?  What's <CODE>first</CODE> of that result?  What's <CODE>first</CODE> of <EM>that</EM> result?
 
<P>A pitfall that sounds unlikely in the abstract but is actually
surprisingly common is to try to do the second step of the procedure &quot;by
hand&quot; instead of trusting the recursion to do it.  For example, here's
another attempt at that <CODE>down</CODE> procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (down wd)                            ;; incomplete
  (se wd &hellip;))
</PRE> 
 
<P>You know the first word in the result has to be the argument
word.  Then what?  The next thing is the same word with its last letter
missing:
 
<P><PRE>(define (down wd)                            ;; wrong!
  (se wd (bl wd) &hellip;))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Instead of taking care of the entire rest of the problem with a
recursive call, it's tempting to take only one more step, figuring out how
to include the second word of the required solution.  But that approach
won't get you to a general recursive solution.  Just take the first step
and then trust the recursion for the rest:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g6"></A>down wd)
  (if (empty? wd)
      '()
      (se wd (down (bl wd)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>The value returned in the base case of your procedure must be in the
range of the function you are representing.  If your function is supposed to
return a number, it must return a number all the time, even in the base
case.  You can use this idea to help you check the correctness of the
base case expression.
 
<P>For example, in <CODE>downup</CODE>, the base case returns <CODE>(se wd)</CODE> for the
base case argument of a one-letter word.  How did we think to enclose the
word in a sentence?  We know that in the recursive cases <CODE>downup</CODE> always
returns a sentence, so that suggests to us that it must return a sentence in
the base case also.
 
<P>If your base case doesn't make sense in its own right, it probably
means that you're trying to compensate for a mistake in the recursive case.
 
<P>For example, suppose you've fallen into the pitfall of trying to handle the
second word of a sentence by hand, and you've written the following
procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (square-sent sent)                   ;; wrong
  (if (empty? sent)
      '()
      (se (square (first sent))
      (square (first (bf sent)))
      (square-sent (bf sent)))))
 
&gt; (square-sent '(2 3))
ERROR: Invalid argument to FIRST:  ()
</PRE> 
 
<P>After some experimentation, you find that you can get this example
to work by changing the base case:
 
<P><PRE>(define (square-sent sent)                   ;; still wrong
  (if (= (count sent) 1)
      '()
      (se (square (first sent))
      (square (first (bf sent)))
      (square-sent (bf sent)))))
 
&gt; (square-sent '(2 3))
(4 9)
</PRE> 
 
<P>The trouble is that the base case doesn't make sense on its own:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (square-sent '(7))
()
</PRE> 
 
<P>In fact, this procedure doesn't work for any sentences of length
other than two.  The moral is that it doesn't work to correct an error in the
recursive case by introducing an absurd base case.
