<P>Here's how we might rewrite <CODE><A NAME="g2"></A>downup</CODE> using the leap of faith
method.  Start by looking at the desired return value for a medium-sized
example:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (downup 'paul)
(PAUL PAU PA P PA PAU PAUL)
</PRE> 
 
<P>Since this is a procedure whose argument is a word, we guess that
the <CODE>butfirst</CODE> or the <CODE>butlast</CODE> might be helpful.
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (downup 'aul)
(AUL AU A AU AUL)
 
&gt; (downup 'pau)
(PAU PA P PA PAU)
</PRE> 
 
<P>This is a case in which it matters which we choose; the solution for the
<CODE>butfirst</CODE> of the original argument doesn't help, but the solution for
the <CODE>butlast</CODE> is most of the solution for the original word.  All we
have to do is add the original word itself at the beginning and end:
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup wd)                          ;; no base case
  (se wd (downup (bl wd)) wd))
</PRE> 
 
<P>As before, this is missing the base case, but by now you know how
to fill that in.
