<P>To make the leap of faith method work, we have to find a smaller, similar
subproblem whose solution will help solve the given problem.  How do we find
such a smaller subproblem?
 
<P>In the examples so far, we've generally found it by finding a smaller,
similar <EM>return value</EM> within the return value we're trying to
achieve.  Then we worked backward from the smaller solution to figure out
what smaller argument would give us that value.  For example, here's how we
solved the <CODE>reverse</CODE> problem:
 
<P><TABLE><TR><TD>original argument<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>beatles</CODE> 
<TR><TD>desired return value<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>SELTAEB</CODE> 
<TR><TD>smaller return value<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>ELTAEB</CODE> 
<TR><TD>corresponding argument<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>beatle</CODE> 
<TR><TD>relationship of arguments
<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>beatle </CODE>is<CODE> (bl 'beatles)</CODE> 
<TR><TD>Scheme expression<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>(word (last arg)
<TR><TD>&nbsp;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(reverse (bl arg)))
</TABLE> 
 
 
<P>Similarly, we looked at the definition of 843! and noticed within it
the factorial of a smaller number, 842.
 
<P>But a smaller return value won't necessarily leap out at us in every case.
If not, there are some likely guesses we can try.  For example, if the
problem is about integers, it makes sense to try <EM>n</EM>&minus;1 as a smaller
argument.  If the problem is about words or sentences, try the <CODE>butfirst</CODE> or the <CODE>butlast</CODE>.  (Often, as in the <CODE>reverse</CODE> example,
either will be helpful.)  Once you've guessed at a smaller argument, see
what the corresponding return value should be, then compare that with the
original desired return value as we've described earlier.
 
<P>In fact, these two argument-guessing techniques would have suggested the same
subproblems that we ended up using in our two examples so far.  The reason we
didn't teach these techniques from the beginning is that we don't want you
to think they're essential parts of the leap of faith method.  These are
just good guesses; they don't always work.  When they don't, you have to be
prepared to think more flexibly.
