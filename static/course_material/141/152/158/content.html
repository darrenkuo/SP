<P>We'll use the leap of faith method to solve another problem that
we haven't already solved with the combining method.
 
<P>The factorial of a number <EM>n</EM> is defined as 1&#x00d7;2&#x00d7;&#x00b7;&#x00b7;&#x00b7;&#x00d7;<EM>n</EM>.  So the factorial of 5 (written &quot;5!&quot;) is 1&#x00d7;2&#x00d7;3&#x00d7;4&#x00d7;5.  Suppose you want Scheme to figure out the factorial of
some large number, such as 843.  You start from the definition:  843! is 1&#x00d7;2&#x00d7;&#x00b7;&#x00b7;&#x00b7;&#x00d7;842&#x00d7;843.  Now you have to look for
another factorial problem whose answer will help us find the answer to
843!.  You might notice that 2!, that is, 1&#x00d7;2, is part of 843!,
but that doesn't help very much because there's no simple relationship
between 2! and 843!.  A more fruitful observation would be that 842!
is 1&#x00d7;&#x00b7;&#x00b7;&#x00b7;&#x00d7;842&mdash;that is, all but the last number in the
product we're trying to compute.  So 843! = 843&#x00d7;842!.  In general,
<EM>n</EM>! is <EM>n</EM>&#x00d7;(<EM>n</EM>-1)!.  We can embody this idea in a Scheme procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (factorial n)                        ;; first version
  (* n (factorial (- n 1))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Asking for (<EM>n</EM>-1)! is the leap of faith.  We're expressing an
answer we don't know, 843!, in terms of another answer we don't know,
842!.  But since 842! is a smaller, similar subproblem, we are confident
that the same algorithm will find it.

<p><small><small>What makes us confident?  We imagine that we've worked on
this problem using the combining method, so that we've written procedures like
these:

<pre>(define (factorial1 n)
  1)

(define (factorial2 n)
  (* 2 (factorial1 (- n 1))))

(define (factorial3 n)
  (* 3 (factorial2 (- n 1))))

; ...

(define (factorial842 n)
  (* 842 (factorial841 (- n 1))))
</pre>

<p>and therefore we're entitled to use those lower-numbered versions in
finding the factorial of 843.  We haven't actually written them, but we could
have, and that's what justifies using them. The reason we can take 842! on
faith is that 842 is smaller than 843; it's the smaller values that we're
pretending we've already written.</small></small>

<P>Remember that in the <CODE>reverse</CODE> problem we mentioned that we could have
chosen either the <CODE>butfirst</CODE> or the <CODE>butlast</CODE> of the argument as the
smaller subproblem?  In the case of the <CODE>factorial</CODE> problem we don't
have a similar choice.  If we tried to subdivide the problem as
 
<P><P ALIGN="center">6! = 1&#x00d7;(2&#x00d7;3&#x00d7;4&#x00d7;5&#x00d7;6)</P> 
<P> 
 
then the part in
parentheses would <EM>not</EM> be the factorial of a smaller
number.

<p><small><small>As it happens, the part in parentheses does equal the
factorial of a number, 6 itself.  Bul expressing the solution for 6 in terms
of the solution for 6 doesn't lead to a recursive procedure; we have to
express this solution in terms of a <em>smaller</em> one.
 
<P>As the base case for <CODE>factorial</CODE>, we'll use 1! = 1.
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g1"></A>factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</PRE>
