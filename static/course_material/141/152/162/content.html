<P>The leap of faith is mostly about recursive cases, not base cases.  In the
examples in this chapter, we've picked base cases without talking about them
much.  How do you pick a base case?
 
<P>In general, we recommend using the smallest possible base case argument,
because that usually leads to the simplest procedures.  For example,
consider using the empty word, empty sentence, or zero instead of one-letter
words, one-word sentences, or one.
 
<P>How can you go about finding the simplest possible base case?  Our first
example in this chapter was <CODE>reverse</CODE>.  We arbitrarily chose to use
one-letter words as the base case:
 
<P><PRE>(define (reverse wd)
  (if (= (count wd) 1)
      wd
      (word (last wd)
        (reverse (bl wd)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Suppose we want to consider whether a smaller base case would work.  One
approach is to pick an argument that would be handled by the current base
case, and see what would happen if we tried to let the recursive step handle
it instead.  (To go along with this experiment, we pick a smaller base case,
since the original base case should now be handled by the recursive step.)
In this example, we pick a one-letter word, let's say <CODE>m</CODE>, and use that
as the value of <CODE>wd</CODE> in the expression
 
<P><PRE>(word (last wd)
      (reverse (bl wd)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>The result is
 
<P><PRE>(word (last 'm)
      (reverse (bl 'm)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>which is the same as
 
<P><PRE>(word 'm
      (reverse &quot;&quot;))
</PRE> 
 
<P>We want this to have as its value the word <CODE>M</CODE>.  This will
work out provided that <CODE>(reverse &quot;&quot;)</CODE> has the empty word as its value.
So we could rewrite the procedure this way:
 
<P><PRE>(define (reverse wd)
  (if (empty? wd)
      &quot;"
      (word (last word)
        (reverse (bl word)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>We were led to this empty-word base case by working downward from the needs
of the one-letter case.  However, it's also important to ensure that the
return value used for the empty word is the correct value, not only to make
the recursion work, but for an empty word in its own right.  That is, we
have to convince ourselves that <CODE>(reverse &quot;&quot;)</CODE> should return an empty
word.  But it should; the <CODE>reverse</CODE> of any word is a word containing the
same letters as the original word.  If the original has no letters, the <CODE>reverse</CODE> must have no letters also.  This exemplifies a general principle:
Although we choose a base case argument for the sake of the recursive step,
we must choose the corresponding return value for the sake of the argument
itself, not just for the sake of the recursion.
 
<P>We'll try the base case reduction technique on <CODE>downup</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup wd)
  (if (= (count wd) 1)
      (se wd)
      (se wd (downup (bl wd)) wd)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>If we want to use the empty word as the base case, instead of
one-letter words, then we have to ensure that the recursive case can return
a correct answer for a one-letter word.  The behavior we want is
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (downup 'a)
(A)
</PRE> 
 
<P>But if we substitute <CODE>'a</CODE> for <CODE>wd</CODE> in the recursive-case
expression we get
 
<P><PRE>(se 'a (downup &quot;&quot;) 'a)
</PRE> 
 
<P>which will have two copies of the word <CODE>A</CODE> in its value no
matter what value we give to <CODE>downup</CODE> of the empty word.  We can't
avoid treating one-letter words as a base case.
 
<P>In writing <CODE>factorial</CODE>, we used <CODE>1</CODE> as the base case.
 
<P><PRE>(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Our principle of base case reduction suggests that we try for <CODE>0</CODE>.  To do this, we substitute <CODE>1</CODE> for <CODE>n</CODE> in the recursive case
expression:
 
<P><PRE>(* 1 (factorial 0))
</PRE> 
 
<P>We'd like this to have the value <CODE>1</CODE>; this will be true only
if we define 0! = 1.  Now we can say
 
<P><PRE>(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>In this case, the new procedure is no simpler than the previous
version.  Its only advantage is that it handles a case, 0!, that
mathematicians find useful.
 
<P>Here's another example in which we can't reduce the base case to an empty
word.  In the previous chapter we used the combining method to write
<CODE>letter-pairs</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(define (letter-pairs wd)
  (if (&lt;= (count wd) 1)
      '()
      (se (first-two wd)
      (letter-pairs (bf wd)))))
 
(define (first-two wd)
  (word (first wd) (first (bf wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>It might occur to you that one-letter words could be handled
by the recursive case, and the base case could then handle only the empty
word.  But if you try to evaluate the expression for the recursive case
as applied to a one-letter word, you find that
 
<P><PRE>(first-two 'a)
</PRE> 
 
<P>is equivalent to
 
<P><PRE>(word (first 'a) (first (bf 'a)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>which is an error.  There is no second letter of a one-letter
word.  As soon as you see the expression <CODE>(first (bf wd))</CODE> within
this program, you know that one-letter words must be part of the base case.
The same kind of reasoning can be used in many problems; the base case must
handle anything that's too small to fit the needs of the recursive case.
