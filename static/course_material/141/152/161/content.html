<P>Here's a case in which mindlessly guessing <CODE>butfirst</CODE> or <CODE>butlast</CODE> 
doesn't lead to a very good solution.  We want a procedure that takes a
sentence as its argument and returns a sentence of the even-numbered words
of the original sentence:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (<A NAME="g3"></A>evens '(i want to hold your hand))
(WANT HOLD HAND)
</PRE> 
 
<P>We look at <CODE>evens</CODE> of the <CODE>butfirst</CODE> and <CODE>butlast</CODE> of
this sentence:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (evens '(want to hold your hand))
(TO YOUR)
 
&gt; (evens '(i want to hold your))
(WANT HOLD)
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>Butfirst</CODE> is clearly not helpful; it gives all the wrong
words.  <CODE>Butlast</CODE> looks promising.  The relationship between <CODE>evens</CODE> 
of the bigger sentence and <CODE>evens</CODE> of the smaller sentence is that the
last word of the larger sentence is missing from <CODE>evens</CODE> of the smaller
sentence.
 
<P><PRE>(define (losing-evens sent)                  ;; no base case
  (se (losing-evens (bl sent))
      (last sent)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>For a base case, we'll take the empty sentence:
 
<P><PRE>(define (losing-evens sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      '()
      (se (losing-evens (bl sent))
      (last sent))))
 
&gt; (losing-evens '(i want to hold your hand))
(I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND)
</PRE> 
 
<P>This isn't quite right.
 
<P>It's true that <CODE>evens</CODE> of <CODE>(i want to hold your hand)</CODE> is the same
as <CODE>evens</CODE> of <CODE>(i want to hold your)</CODE> plus the word <CODE>hand</CODE> at
the end.  But what about <CODE>evens</CODE> of <CODE>(i want to hold your)</CODE>?  By the
reasoning we've been using, we would expect that to be <CODE>evens</CODE> of <CODE>(i want to hold)</CODE> plus the word <CODE>your</CODE>.  But since the word <CODE>your</CODE> 
is the fifth word of the argument sentence, it shouldn't be part of the
result at all.  Here's how <CODE>evens</CODE> should work:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (evens '(i want to hold your))
(WANT HOLD)
 
&gt; (evens '(i want to hold))
(WANT HOLD)
</PRE> 
 
<P>When the sentence has an odd number of words, its <CODE>evens</CODE> is
the same as the <CODE>evens</CODE> of its <CODE>butlast</CODE>. So here's our
new procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (evens sent)                         ;; better version
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
    ((odd? (count sent))
     (evens (bl sent)))
    (else (se (evens (bl sent))
      (last sent)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>This version works, but it's more complicated than necessary.  What makes it
complicated is that on each recursive call we switch between two kinds of
problems: even-length and odd-length sentences.  If we dealt with the words
two at a time, each recursive call would see the same kind of problem.
 
<P>Once we've decided to go through the sentence two words at a time, we can
reopen the question of whether to go right-to-left or left-to-right.  It
will turn out that the latter gives us the simplest procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (evens sent)                         ;; best version
  (if (&lt;= (count sent) 1)
      '()
      (se (first (bf sent))
      (evens (bf (bf sent))))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Since we go through the sentence two words at a time, an
odd-length argument sentence always gives rise to an odd-length recursive
subproblem.  Therefore, it's not good enough to check for an empty sentence
as the only base case.  We need to treat both the empty sentence and one-word
sentences as base cases.
