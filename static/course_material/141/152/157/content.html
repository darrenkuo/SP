<P>Of course, our definition of <CODE>reverse</CODE> isn't finished yet: As always, we
need a base case.  But base cases are the easy part.  Base cases transform
simple arguments into simple answers, and you can do that transformation in
your head.
 
<P>For example, what's the simplest argument to <CODE>reverse</CODE>?  If you
answered &quot;a one-letter word&quot; then pick a one-letter word and decide what
the result should be:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (reverse 'x)
X
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>reverse</CODE> of a one-letter word should just be that same word:
 
<P><PRE>(define (reverse wd)
  (if (= (count wd) 1)
      wd
      (word (last wd)
        (reverse (bl wd)))))
</PRE>
