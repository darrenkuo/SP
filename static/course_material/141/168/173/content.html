<P>Let's say we want a procedure <CODE>every-nth</CODE> that takes a number <EM>n</EM> and a
sentence as arguments and selects every <EM>n</EM>th word from the sentence.
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (every-nth 3 '(with a little help from my friends))
(LITTLE MY)
</PRE> 
 
<P>We get in trouble if we try to write this in the obvious way, as a sort of
<CODE>keep</CODE> pattern.
 
<P><PRE>(define (every-nth n sent)                   ;; wrong!
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((= n 1)
         (se (first sent) (every-nth <STRONG><BIG>n</BIG></STRONG> (bf sent))))
        (else (every-nth (- n 1) (bf sent)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>The problem is with the <CODE><B>n</B></CODE> that's in boldface.
We're thinking that it's going to be the <CODE>n</CODE> of the <EM>original</EM> 
invocation of <CODE>every-nth</CODE>, that is, 3.  But in fact, we've already counted
<CODE>n</CODE> down so that in this invocation its value is 1.  (Check out the first
half of the same <CODE>cond</CODE> clause.)  This procedure will correctly skip the
first two words but will keep all the words after that point.  That's
because we're trying to remember two different numbers: the number we
should always skip between kept words, and the number of words we still need
to skip this time.
 
<P> 
If we're trying to remember two numbers, we need two names for them.  The
way to achieve this is to have our official <CODE>every-nth</CODE> procedure call a
<A NAME="g15"></A><A NAME="g16"></A>helper procedure that takes an extra argument and does the real work:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g17"></A>every-nth n sent)
  (every-nth-helper n n sent))
 
(define (<A NAME="g18"></A>every-nth-helper interval remaining sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((= remaining 1)
         (se (first sent)
             (every-nth-helper interval interval (bf sent))))
        (else (every-nth-helper interval (- remaining 1) (bf sent)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>This procedure always calls itself recursively with the same value
of <CODE>interval</CODE>, but with a different value of <CODE>remaining</CODE> each time.
<CODE>Remaining</CODE> keeps getting smaller by one in each recursive call until it
equals 1.  On that call, a word is kept for the return value, and we call
<CODE>every-nth-helper</CODE> recursively with the value of <CODE>interval</CODE>, that is,
the <EM>original</EM> value of <CODE>n</CODE>, as the new <CODE>remaining</CODE>.
If you like, you can think of this combination of an <EM>initialization</EM> 
<A NAME="g19"></A> 
<A NAME="g20"></A> 
procedure and a <EM>helper</EM> procedure as another pattern for your
collection.
