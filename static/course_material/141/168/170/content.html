<P>In the <CODE>every</CODE> pattern, we collect the results of transforming each
element of a word or sentence into something else.  This time we'll consider
a different kind of problem: choosing some of the elements and forgetting
about the others.  First, here is a procedure to select the three-letter
words from a sentence:
 
<P> 
<PRE>(define (keep-three-letter-words sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((= (count (first sent)) 3)
         (se (first sent) (keep-three-letter-words (bf sent))))
        (else (keep-three-letter-words (bf sent)))))
 
&gt; (keep-three-letter-words '(one two three four five six seven))
(ONE TWO SIX)
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
Next, here is a procedure to select the vowels from a word:
 
<P><PRE>(define (keep-vowels wd)
  (cond ((empty? wd) &quot;&quot;)
        ((vowel? (first wd))
         (word (first wd) (keep-vowels (bf wd))))
        (else (keep-vowels (bf wd)))))
 
&gt; (keep-vowels 'napoleon)
AOEO
</PRE> 
 
<P>Let's look at the differences between the <CODE>every</CODE> pattern and the
<A NAME="g5"></A><A NAME="g6"></A> pattern.  First of all, the <CODE>keep</CODE> procedures have three
possible outcomes, instead of just two as in most <CODE>every</CODE>-like
procedures.  In the <CODE>every</CODE> pattern, we only have to distinguish between
the base case and the recursive case.  In the <CODE>keep</CODE> pattern, there is
still a base case, but there are <EM>two</EM> recursive cases; we have to
decide whether or not to keep the first available element in the return
value.  When we do keep an element, we keep the element itself, not some
function of the element.
 
<P>As with the <CODE>every</CODE> pattern, there are situations that follow the <CODE>keep</CODE> pattern only approximately.  Suppose we want to look for doubled
letters within a word:
 
<P> 
<PRE>&gt; (doubles 'bookkeeper)
OOKKEE
 
&gt; (doubles 'mississippi)
SSSSPP
</PRE> 
 
<P>This isn't a pure <CODE>keep</CODE> pattern example because we can't
decide whether to keep the first letter by looking at that letter alone; we
have to examine two at a time.  But we can write a procedure using more or
less the same pattern:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g7"></A>doubles wd)
  (cond ((= (count wd) 1) &quot;&quot;)
        ((equal? (first wd) (first (bf wd)))
         (word (first wd) (first (bf wd)) (doubles (bf (bf wd)))))
        (else (doubles (bf wd)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>As in the <CODE>evens</CODE> example of Chapter 12, the base case of
<CODE>doubles</CODE> is unusual, and one of the recursive calls chops off two
letters at once in forming the smaller subproblem.  But the structure of the
<CODE>cond</CODE> with a base case clause, a clause for keeping letters, and a
clause for rejecting letters is maintained.
