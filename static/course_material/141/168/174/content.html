<P>One way in which recursive patterns can be useful is if you think of them as
templates with empty slots to fill in for a particular problem.  Here are
template versions of the <CODE>every</CODE>, <CODE>keep</CODE>, and <CODE>accumulate</CODE> 
patterns as applied to sentences:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<B>every-something</B> sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      '()
      (se (______ (first sent))
      (<B>every-something</B> (bf sent)))))
 
(define (<B>keep-if-something</B> sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
    ((______<STRONG><BIG>?</BIG></STRONG> (first sent))
     (se (first sent) (<B>keep-if-something</B> (bf sent))))
    (else (<B>keep-if-something</B> (bf sent)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
<A NAME="keeptemplate"></A> 
<PRE>(define (<B>accumulate-somehow</B> sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      ______
      (______ (first sent)
              (<B>accumulate-somehow</B> (bf sent)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Suppose you're trying to write a procedure <CODE>first-number</CODE> that takes a
sentence as its argument and returns the first number in that sentence, but
returns the word <CODE>no-number</CODE> if there are no numbers in the argument.
The first step is to make a guess about which pattern will be most useful.
In this case the program should start with an entire sentence and select a
portion of that sentence, namely one word.  Therefore, we start with the
<CODE>keep</CODE> pattern.
 
<P><PRE>(define (first-number sent)                  ;; first guess
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
    ((______ (first sent))
     (se (first sent) (first-number (bf sent))))
    (else (first-number (bf sent)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>The next step is to fill in the blank.  Obviously, since we're looking for a
number, <CODE>number?</CODE> goes in the blank.
 
<P>The trouble is that this procedure returns <EM>all</EM> the numbers in the
given sentence.  Now our job is to see how the pattern must be modified to
do what we want.  The overall structure of the pattern is a <CODE>cond</CODE> with three clauses; we'll consider each clause separately.
 
<P>What should the procedure return if <CODE>sent</CODE> is empty?  In that case,
there is no first number in the sentence, so it should return <CODE>no-number</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>((empty? sent) <B>'no-number</B>)
</PRE> 
 
<P>What if the first word of the sentence is a number?  The program should
return just that number, ignoring the rest of the sentence:
 
<P><PRE>((number? (first sent)) <B>(first sent)</B>)
</PRE> 
 
<P>What if the first word of the sentence isn't a number?  The procedure must
make a recursive call for the <CODE>butfirst</CODE>, and whatever that recursive
call returns is the answer.  So the <CODE>else</CODE> clause does not have to be
changed.
 
<P>Here's the whole procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g21"></A>first-number sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) 'no-number)
    ((number? (first sent)) (first sent))
    (else (first-number (bf sent)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>After filling in the blank in the <CODE>keep</CODE> pattern, we solved this problem
by focusing on the details of the procedure definition.  We examined each
piece of the definition to decide what changes were necessary.  Instead, we
could have focused on the <EM>behavior</EM> of the procedure.  We would have
found two ways in which the program didn't do what it was supposed to do:
For an argument sentence containing numbers, it would return all of the
numbers instead of just one of them.  For a sentence without numbers, it
would return the empty sentence instead of <CODE>no-number</CODE>.  We would then
have finished the job by <EM>debugging</EM> the procedure to fix each of these
problems.  The final result would have been the same.
