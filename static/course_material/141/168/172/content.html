<P>This procedure combines aspects of <CODE>keep</CODE> with aspects of <CODE>accumulate</CODE>.  We want to do two things at once: get rid of the words that
aren't numbers and compute the <EM>sum</EM> of those that are numbers.  (A
simple <CODE>keep</CODE> would construct a sentence of them.)  <CODE>Add-numbers</CODE> 
looks exactly like the <CODE>keep</CODE> pattern, except that there's a funny
combiner and a funny base case, which look more like <CODE>accumulate</CODE>.
 
<P> 
Here's an example that combines <CODE>every</CODE> and <CODE>keep</CODE>.  We want a
procedure that takes a sentence as its argument and translates every word of
the sentence into Pig Latin, but leaves out words that have no vowels,
because the Pig Latin translator doesn't work for such words.  The procedure
<CODE>safe-pigl</CODE> will be like a <CODE>keep</CODE> pattern in that it keeps only
words that contain vowels, but like an <CODE>every</CODE> in that the result
contains transformed versions of the selected words, rather than the words
themselves.
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g12"></A>safe-pigl sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
    ((has-vowel? (first sent))
     (se (pigl (first sent)) (safe-pigl (bf sent))))
    (else (safe-pigl (bf sent)))))
 
(define (<A NAME="g13"></A>has-vowel? wd)
  (not (empty? (keep-vowels wd))))
 
&gt; (safe-pigl '(my pet fly is named xyzzy))

<P> 
Finally, here's an example that combines all three patterns.  In Chapter
1 we wrote (using higher-order procedures) the <CODE>acronym</CODE> 
procedure, which selects the &quot;real&quot; words of a sentence (the <CODE>keep</CODE> 
pattern), takes the first letter of each word (the <CODE>every</CODE> pattern), and
combines these initial letters into a single word (the <CODE>accumulate</CODE> 
pattern).  In a recursive procedure we can carry out all three steps at once:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g14"></A>acronym sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) &quot;&quot;)
    ((real-word? (first sent))
     (word (first (first sent))
           (acronym (bf sent))))
    (else (acronym (bf sent)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Don't become obsessed with trying to make every recursive problem fit one of
the three patterns we've shown here.  As we said at the beginning of the
chapter, what's most important is that you understand the principles of
recursion in general, and understand how versatile recursion is.  The
patterns are just special cases that happen to come up fairly often.
