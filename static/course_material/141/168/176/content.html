<P>Review the pitfalls from Chapter 12; they're still relevant.
 
<P> 
<P>&rArr; How do you test for the base case?  Most of the examples in this
chapter have used <CODE>empty?</CODE>, and it's easy to fall into the habit of
using that test without thinking.  But, for example, if the argument is a
number, that's probably the wrong test.  Even when the argument is a
sentence or a non-numeric word, it may not be empty in the base case, as in
the Pig Latin example.  
 
<P>&rArr; A serious pitfall is failing to recognize a situation in which you
need an extra variable and therefore need a helper procedure.  If at each step
you need the entire original argument as well as the argument that's getting
closer to the base case, you probably need a helper procedure.  For example,
write a procedure <CODE>pairs</CODE> that takes a word as argument and returns
a sentence of all possible two-letter words made of letters from the argument
word, allowing duplicates, like this:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (pairs 'toy)
(TT TO TY OT OO OY YT YO YY)
</PRE> 
 
<P>&rArr; A simple pitfall, when using a helper procedure, is to write a
recursive call in the helper that calls the main procedure instead of calling
the helper.  (For example, what would have happened if we'd had
<CODE>every-nth-helper</CODE> invoke <CODE>every-nth</CODE> instead of
invoking itself?)

<P>&rArr; Some recursive procedures with more than one argument require more than
one base case.  But some don't.  One pitfall is to leave out a necessary
base case; another is to include something that looks like a base case but
doesn't fit the structure of the program.
 
<P>For example, the reason <CODE>sent-before?</CODE> needs two base cases is that on
each recursive call, both <CODE>sent1</CODE> and <CODE>sent2</CODE> get smaller.  Either
sentence might run out first, and the procedure should return different values
in those two cases.
 
<P>On the other hand, Exercise <A HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ssch11/recursion.html#copies">11.7</A> asked you to write a procedure that has
two arguments but needs only one base case:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g23"></A>copies num wd)
  (if (= num 0)
      '()
      (se wd (copies (- num 1) wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>In this example, the <CODE>wd</CODE> argument <EM>doesn't</EM> get smaller
from one invocation to the next.  It would be silly to test for <CODE>(empty? wd)</CODE>.
 
<P>A noteworthy intermediate case is <CODE><A NAME="g24"></A>every-nth-helper</CODE>.  It does
have two <CODE>cond</CODE> clauses that check for two different arguments reaching
their smallest allowable values, but the <CODE>remaining</CODE> clause isn't a base
case.  If <CODE>remaining</CODE> has the value 1, the procedure still invokes itself
recursively.
 
<P>The only general principle we can offer is that you have to think about what
base cases are appropriate, not just routinely copy whatever worked last
time.
