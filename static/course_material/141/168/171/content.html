<P>Here are two recursive procedures for functions that combine all of the
elements of the argument into a single result:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g8"></A>addup nums)
  (if (empty? nums)
      0
      (+ (first nums) (addup (bf nums)))))
 
(define (<A NAME="g9"></A>scrunch-words sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      &quot;"
      (word (first sent) (scrunch-words (bf sent)))))
 
&gt; (addup '(8 3 6 1 10))
28
 
&gt; (scrunch-words '(ack now ledge able))
ACKNOWLEDGEABLE
</PRE> 
 
<P>What's the pattern?  We're using some combiner (<CODE>+</CODE> or <CODE>word</CODE>) to connect the word we're up to with the result of the recursive
call.  The base case tests for an empty argument, but the base case return
value must be the identity element of the combiner function.
 
<P>If there is no identity element for the combiner, as in the case of
<CODE>max</CODE>, we modify the pattern slightly:<sup>*</sup>
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g10"></A>sent-max sent)
  (if (= (count sent) 1)
      (first sent)
      (max (first sent)
       (sent-max (bf sent)))))
</PRE>      
 
<P><small><small><sup>*</sup>Of course, if your version of Scheme has
&minus;&infin;, you can use it as the return value for an empty sentence,
instead of changing the pattern.</small></small>
