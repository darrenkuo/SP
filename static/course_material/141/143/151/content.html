<P>Every recursive procedure must include two parts: one or more recursive
cases, in which the recursion reduces the size of the problem, and one or
more base cases, in which the result is computable without recursion.  For
example, our first attempt at <CODE>downup</CODE> fell into this pitfall because we
had no base case.
 
<P>Don't be too eager to write the recursive procedure.  As we showed
in the <CODE>letter-pairs</CODE> example, what looks like a generalizable
pattern may not be.
