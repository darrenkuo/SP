<P>Since we don't yet know how to solve the <CODE>downup</CODE> problem in general,
let's start with a particular case that we <EM>can</EM> solve.  We'll write a
version of <CODE>downup</CODE> that works only for one-letter words:
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup1 wd)
  (se wd))
 
&gt; (downup1 'a)
(A)
</PRE> 
 
<P>So far so good!  This isn't a very versatile program, but it does have the
advantage of being easy to write.
 
<P>Now let's see if we can do two-letter words:
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup2 wd)
  (se wd (first wd) wd))
 
&gt; (downup2 'be)
(BE B BE)
</PRE> 
 
<P>Moving right along&hellip;
<PRE>(define (downup3 wd)
  (se wd
      (bl wd)
      (first wd)
      (bl wd)
      wd))
 
&gt; (downup3 'foo)
(FOO FO F FO FOO)
</PRE> 
 
<P>We could continue along these lines, writing procedures <CODE>downup4</CODE> and so
on.  If we knew that the longest word in English had 83 letters, we could
write all of the single-length <CODE>downup</CODE>s up to <CODE>downup83</CODE>, and then
write one overall <CODE>downup</CODE> procedure that would consist of an enormous
<CODE>cond</CODE> with 83 clauses, one for each length.
