<P>But that's a terrible idea.  We'd get really bored, and start making a lot
of mistakes, if we tried to work up to <CODE>downup83</CODE> this way.
 
<P>The next trick is to notice that the middle part of what <CODE>(downup3 'foo)</CODE> does is just like <CODE>(downup2 'fo)</CODE>:
 
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="###content_dir###/uparrow.jpg" ALT="figure: uparrow"></CENTER> 
 
<P> 
<P>So we can find the parts of <CODE>downup3</CODE> that are responsible for
those three words:
 
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="###content_dir###/curvedarrow.jpg" ALT="figure: curvedarrow"></CENTER> 
 
<P> 
<P>and replace them with an invocation of <CODE>downup2</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup3 wd)
  (se wd (downup2 (bl wd)) wd))
</PRE> 
 
<P>How about <CODE>downup4</CODE>?  Once we've had this great idea about using <CODE>downup2</CODE> to help with <CODE>downup3</CODE>, it's not hard to continue the pattern:
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup4 wd)
  (se wd (downup3 (bl wd)) wd))
 
&gt; (downup4 'paul)
(PAUL PAU PA P PA PAU PAUL)
</PRE> 
 
<P>The reason we can fit the body of <CODE>downup4</CODE> on one line is that most of
its work is done for it by <CODE>downup3</CODE>.  If we continued writing each new
<CODE>downup</CODE> procedure independently, as we did in our first attempt at <CODE>downup3</CODE>, our procedures would be getting longer and longer.  But this new
way avoids that.
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup59 wd)
  (se wd (downup58 (bl wd)) wd))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Also, although it may be harder to notice, we can even rewrite <CODE>downup2</CODE> 
along the same lines:
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup2 wd)
  (se wd (downup1 (bl wd)) wd))
</PRE>
