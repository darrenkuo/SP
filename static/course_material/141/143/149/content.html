<P>Let's take another example; we'll write the <A NAME="g7"></A><A NAME="g8"></A>Pig Latin procedure
that we showed off in Chapter 1.  We're trying to take a word, move
all the initial consonants to the end, and add &quot;ay.&quot;
 
<P>The simplest case is that there are no initial consonants to move:
 
<P><PRE>(define (pigl0 wd)
  (word wd 'ay))
 
&gt; (pigl0 'alabaster)
ALABASTERAY
</PRE> 
 
<P>(This will turn out to be the base case of our eventual
recursive procedure.)
 
<P>The next-simplest case is a word that starts with one consonant.  The
obvious way to write this is
 
<P><PRE>(define (pigl1 wd)                           ;; obvious version
  (word (bf wd) (first wd) 'ay))
 
&gt; (pigl1 'salami)
ALAMISAY
</PRE> 
 
<P>but, as in the <CODE>downup</CODE> example, we'd like to find a way to use
<CODE>pigl0</CODE> in implementing <CODE>pigl1</CODE>.  This case isn't exactly like <CODE>downup</CODE>, because there isn't a piece of the return value that we can draw a
box around to indicate that <CODE>pigl0</CODE> returns that piece.  Instead, <CODE>pigl0</CODE> puts the letters <CODE>ay</CODE> at the end of some word, and so does <CODE>pigl1</CODE>.  The difference is that <CODE>pigl1</CODE> puts <CODE>ay</CODE> at the end of
a <EM>rearrangement</EM> of its argument word.  To make this point clearer,
we'll rewrite <CODE>pigl1</CODE> in a way that separates the rearrangement from the
<CODE>ay</CODE> addition:
 
<P><PRE>(define (pigl1 wd)
  (word (word (bf wd) (first wd))
    'ay))
 
&gt; (pigl1 'pastrami)
ASTRAMIPAY
</PRE> 
 
<P>Now we actually replace the <CODE>pigl0</CODE>-like part with an
invocation.  We want to replace <CODE>(word <CODE><EM>something</EM></CODE> 'ay)</CODE> with
<CODE>(pigl0 <CODE><EM>something</EM></CODE>)</CODE>.  If we use <CODE>pigl0</CODE> to attach the
<CODE>ay</CODE> at the end, our new version of <CODE>pigl1</CODE> looks like this:
 
<P><PRE>(define (pigl1 wd)
  (pigl0 (word (bf wd) (first wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>How about a word starting with two consonants?  By now we know that we're
going to try to use <CODE>pigl1</CODE> as a helper procedure, so let's skip writing
<CODE>pigl2</CODE> the long way.  We can just move the first consonant to the end
of the word, and handle the result, a word with only one consonant in front,
with <CODE>pigl1</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(define (pigl2 wd)
  (pigl1 (word (bf wd) (first wd))))
 
&gt; (pigl2 'trample)
AMPLETRAY
</PRE> 
 
<P>For a three-initial-consonant word we move one letter to the end and call
<CODE>pigl2</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(define (pigl3 wd)
  (pigl2 (word (bf wd) (first wd))))
 
&gt; (pigl3 'chrome)
OMECHRAY
</PRE> 
 
<P>So how about a version that will work for any word? The recursive case will involve taking the <CODE>pigl</CODE> of <CODE>(word (bf wd) (first wd))</CODE>, to match the pattern we found in
<CODE>pigl1</CODE>, <CODE>pigl2</CODE>, and <CODE>pigl3</CODE>.  The base case will be a word
that begins with a vowel, for which we'll just add <CODE>ay</CODE> on the end, as
<CODE>pigl0</CODE> does:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g9"></A>pigl wd)
  (if (member? (first wd) 'aeiou)
      (word wd 'ay)
      (pigl (word (bf wd) (first wd)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>It's an unusual sense in which <CODE>pigl</CODE>'s recursive call poses a
&quot;smaller&quot; subproblem.  If we're asked for the <CODE>pigl</CODE> of <CODE>scheme</CODE>,
we construct a new word, <CODE>chemes</CODE>, and ask for <CODE>pigl</CODE> of that.  This
doesn't seem like much progress.  We were asked to translate <CODE>scheme</CODE>, a
six-letter word, into Pig Latin, and in order to do this we need to
translate <CODE>chemes</CODE>, another six-letter word, into Pig Latin.
 
<P>But actually this <EM>is</EM> progress, because for Pig Latin the base case
isn't a one-letter word, but rather a word that starts with a vowel.
<CODE>Scheme</CODE> has three consonants before the first vowel; <CODE>chemes</CODE> has
only two consonants before the first vowel.
 
<P><CODE>Chemes</CODE> doesn't begin with a vowel either, so we construct the word
<CODE>hemesc</CODE> and try to <CODE>pigl</CODE> that.  In order to find <CODE>(pigl 'hemesc)</CODE> we need to know <CODE>(pigl 'emesch)</CODE>.  Since <CODE>emesch</CODE> 
<EM>does</EM> begin with a vowel, <CODE>pigl</CODE> returns <CODE>emeschay</CODE>. Once we
know <CODE>(pigl 'emesch)</CODE>, we've thereby found the answer to our original
question.
