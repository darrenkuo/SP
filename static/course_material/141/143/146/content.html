<P>Although <CODE>downup59</CODE> was easy to write, the problem is that it won't work
unless we also define <CODE>downup58</CODE>, which in turn depends on <CODE>downup57</CODE>, and so on.  This is a lot of repetitive, duplicated, and
redundant typing.  Since these procedures are all basically the same, what
we'd like to do is combine them into a single procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup wd)                          ;; first version
  (se wd (downup (bl wd)) wd))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Isn't this a great idea?  We've written one short procedure that
serves as a kind of abbreviation for 59 other ones.
