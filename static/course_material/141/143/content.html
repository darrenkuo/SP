<P>In the next few chapters we're going to talk about <EM>recursion:</EM> solving a big problem by reducing it to a similar,
smaller subproblem.  Actually that's a little backward from the old lady in
the song, who turned her little problem into a similar but <EM>bigger</EM> 
problem!  As the song warns us, this can be fatal.
 
<P>Here's the first problem we'll solve.  We want a function that
works like this:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (<A NAME="g1"></A>downup 'ringo)
(RINGO RING RIN RI R RI RIN RING RINGO)
 
&gt; (downup 'marsupial)
(MARSUPIAL
 MARSUPIA
 MARSUPI
 MARSUP
 MARSU
 MARS
 MAR
 MA
 M
 MA
 MAR
 MARS
 MARSU
 MARSUP
 MARSUPI
 MARSUPIA
 MARSUPIAL)
</PRE> 
 
<P>None of the tools that we've used so far will handle this problem.  It's not
a &quot;compute this function for each letter of the word&quot; problem. Rather, we have to think
about the entire word in a rather complicated way.
 
<P>We're going to solve this problem using recursion.  It turns out that the
idea of recursion is both very powerful&mdash;we can solve a <EM>lot</EM> of
problems using it&mdash;and rather tricky to understand.  That's why we're going
to explain recursion several different ways in the coming chapters.  Even
after you understand one of them, you'll probably find that thinking about
recursion from another point of view enriches your ability to use this idea.
The explanation in this chapter is based on the <EM>combining method.</EM>
