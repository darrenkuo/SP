<P>You've now seen two examples of recursive procedures that we developed using
the combining method.  We started by writing special-case procedures to
handle small problems of a particular size, then simplified the larger
versions by using smaller versions as helper procedures.  Finally we
combined all the nearly identical individual versions into a single
recursive procedure, taking care to handle the base case separately.
 
<P>Here are a couple of problems that can be solved with recursive procedures.
Try them yourself before reading further.  Then we'll show you our solutions.
