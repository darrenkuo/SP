<P>What's the smallest word we can <CODE>explode</CODE>?  There's no reason we
can't explode an empty word:
 
<P><PRE>(define (explode0 wd)
  '())
</PRE> 
 
<P>That wasn't very interesting, though.  It doesn't suggest a
pattern that will apply to larger words.  Let's try a few larger cases:
 
<P><PRE>(define (explode1 wd)
  (se wd))
 
(define (explode2 wd)
  (se (first wd) (last wd)))
 
(define (explode3 wd)
  (se (first wd) (first (bf wd)) (last wd)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>With <CODE>explode3</CODE> the procedure is starting to get complicated enough that
we want to find a way to use <CODE>explode2</CODE> to help.  What <CODE>explode3</CODE> 
does is to pull three separate letters out of its argument word, and collect
the three letters in a sentence.  Here's a sample:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (explode3 'tnt)
(T N T)
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>Explode2</CODE> pulls <EM>two</EM> letters out of a word and
collects them in a sentence.  So we could let <CODE>explode2</CODE> deal with two
of the letters of our three-letter argument, and handle the remaining letter
separately:
 
<P><PRE>(define (explode3 wd)
  (se (first wd) (explode2 (bf wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>We can use similar reasoning to define <CODE>explode4</CODE> in terms of
<CODE>explode3</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(define (explode4 wd)
  (se (first wd) (explode3 (bf wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Now that we see the pattern, what's the base case?  Our first three
numbered <CODE>explode</CODE>s are all different in shape from <CODE>explode3</CODE>,
but now that we know what the pattern should be we'll find that we
can write <CODE>explode2</CODE> in terms of <CODE>explode1</CODE>, and even <CODE>explode1</CODE> 
in terms of <CODE>explode0</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(define (explode2 wd)
  (se (first wd) (explode1 (bf wd))))
 
(define (explode1 wd)
  (se (first wd) (explode0 (bf wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>We would never have thought to write <CODE>explode1</CODE> in that
roundabout way, especially since <CODE>explode0</CODE> pays no attention to
its argument, so computing the <CODE>butfirst</CODE> doesn't contribute
anything to the result, but by following the pattern we can let the
recursive case handle one-letter and two-letter words, so that only
zero-letter words have to be special:
 
<P><A NAME="explodepage"></A> 
<PRE>(define (explode wd)
  (if (empty? wd)
      '()
      (se (first wd) (explode (bf wd)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Now for <CODE>letter-pairs</CODE>.  What's the smallest word we can use as its
argument?  Empty and one-letter words have no letter pairs in them:
 
<P><PRE>(define (letter-pairs0 wd)
  '())
 
(define (letter-pairs1 wd)
  '())
</PRE> 
 
<P>This pattern is not very helpful.
 
<P><PRE>(define (letter-pairs2 wd)
  (se wd))
 
(define (letter-pairs3 wd)
  (se (bl wd) (bf wd)))
 
(define (letter-pairs4 wd)
  (se (bl (bl wd))
      (bl (bf wd))
      (bf (bf wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Again, we want to simplify <CODE>letter-pairs4</CODE> by using <CODE>letter-pairs3</CODE> 
to help.  The problem is similar to <CODE>explode</CODE>:  The value returned by
<CODE>letter-pairs4</CODE> is a three-word sentence, and we can use <CODE>letter-pairs3</CODE> to generate two of those words.
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (letter-pairs4 'nems)
(NE <CODE STYLE="border:solid">EM MS</CODE>)
</PRE> 
 
<P>This gives rise to the following procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (letter-pairs4 wd)
  (se (bl (bl wd))
      (letter-pairs3 (bf wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Does this pattern work for defining <CODE>letter-pairs5</CODE> in terms of <CODE>letter-pairs4</CODE>?
 
<P><PRE>(define (letter-pairs5 wd)                   ;; wrong
  (se (bl (bl wd))
      (letter-pairs4 (bf wd))))
 
&gt; (letter-pairs5 'bagel)
(BAG AG GE EL)
</PRE> 
 
<P>The problem is that <CODE>(bl (bl wd))</CODE> means &quot;the first two letters of <CODE>wd</CODE>&quot; only when <CODE>wd</CODE> has four letters.  In order to be able to
generalize the pattern, we need a way to ask for the first two letters of a
word that works no matter how long the word is.  You wrote a procedure to
solve this problem in Exercise :
 
<P><PRE>(define (first-two wd)
  (word (first wd) (first (bf wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Now we can use this for <CODE>letter-pairs4</CODE> and <CODE>letter-pairs5</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(define (letter-pairs4 wd)
  (se (first-two wd) (letter-pairs3 (bf wd))))
 
(define (letter-pairs5 wd)
  (se (first-two wd) (letter-pairs4 (bf wd))))
</PRE> 
 
<P><EM>This</EM> pattern <EM>does</EM> generalize.
 
<P><PRE>(define (letter-pairs wd)
  (if (&lt;= (count wd) 1)
      '()
      (se (first-two wd)
      (letter-pairs (bf wd)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Note that we treat two-letter and three-letter words as recursive
cases and not as base cases.  Just as in the example of <CODE>explode</CODE>, we
noticed that we could rewrite <CODE>letter-pairs2</CODE> and <CODE>letter-pairs3</CODE> to
follow the same pattern as the larger cases:
 
<P><PRE>(define (letter-pairs2 wd)
  (se (first-two wd)
      (letter-pairs1 (bf wd))))
 
(define (letter-pairs3 wd)
  (se (first-two wd)
      (letter-pairs2 (bf wd))))
</PRE>
