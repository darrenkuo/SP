<P>The little-people model explains recursion very well, as long as you're
willing to focus your attention on the job of one little person, taking the
next little person's subtask as a &quot;black box&quot; that you assume is carried
out correctly.  Your willingness to make that assumption is a necessary step
in becoming truly comfortable with recursive programming.
 
<P>Still, some people are very accustomed to a <EM>sequential</EM> model of
computing.  In that model, there's only one computer, not a lot of little
people, and that one computer has to carry out one step at a time.  If
you're one of those people, you may find it hard to take the subtasks on
faith.  You want to know exactly what happens when!  There's nothing wrong
with such healthy scientific skepticism about recursion.
 
<P>If you're a sequential thinker, you can <EM>trace</EM> procedures to get <A
NAME="g7"></A> detailed information about the sequence of events.<sup>*</sup>
But if you're happy with the way we've been talking about recursion up to now,
and if you find that this section doesn't contribute to your understanding of
recursion, don't worry about it.  Our experience shows that this way of
thinking helps some people but not everybody.<sup>**</sup> Before we get to
recursive procedures, let's just trace some nonrecursive ones:
 
<P><PRE>(define (double wd) (word wd wd))
 
&gt; (trace double)
&gt; (double 'frozen)
<SMALL><CODE>(double frozen)
frozenfrozen
</CODE></SMALL>FROZENFROZEN
</PRE> 

<p><small><small><sup>*</sup> Unfortunately, <code>trace</code> isn't part of
the Scheme standard, so it doesn't behave the same way in every version of
Scheme.</small></small>

<p><small><small><sup>**</sup> Even if tracing doesn't help you with
recursion, you'll find that it's a useful technique in debugging any
procedure.</small></small>
 
<P>The argument to <CODE>trace</CODE> specifies a procedure.  When you
invoke <CODE>trace</CODE>, that procedure becomes &quot;traced&quot;; this means that every time
you invoke the procedure, Scheme will print out the name of the procedure
and the actual arguments.  When the procedure returns a
<A NAME="g8"></A> 
value, Scheme will print that value.

<p><small><small>In this example the return value was printed twice, because
the procedure we traced was invoked directly at the Scheme prompt. Its return
value would have been printed once anyway, just because that's what Scheme
always does.  It was printed another time because of the tracing.  In this
book we've printed the trace-specific output in smaller type and lower-case to
help you understand which is what, but of course on the actual computer you're
on your own.</small></small>
 
<P>Tracing isn't very interesting if we're just invoking a traced procedure
once.  But look what happens when we trace a procedure that we're using
more than once:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (double (double (double 'yum)))
<SMALL><CODE>(double yum)
yumyum
(double yumyum)
yumyumyumyum
(double yumyumyumyum)
yumyumyumyumyumyumyumyum
</CODE></SMALL>YUMYUMYUMYUMYUMYUMYUMYUM
</PRE> 
 
<P>This time, there were three separate
invocations of <CODE>double</CODE>, and we saw each one as it happened.  First we
<CODE>double</CODE>d <CODE>yum</CODE>, and the answer was <CODE>yumyum</CODE>. Then we <CODE>double</CODE>d <CODE>yumyum</CODE>, and so on.  Finally, after we invoked <CODE>double</CODE> for
the last time, its result was printed by the read-eval-print loop.
 
<P> 
<P>When you're finished investigating a procedure, you can turn off tracing by
invoking <A NAME="g9"></A><CODE>untrace</CODE> with the procedure as argument:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (untrace double)
</PRE> 
 
<P>Let's try tracing a recursive procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (downup wd)
  (if (= (count wd) 1)
      (se wd)
      (se wd (downup (bl wd)) wd)))
 
&gt; (trace downup)
 
&gt; (downup 'trace)
<SMALL><CODE>(downup trace)
|  (downup trac)
|  |  (downup tra)
|  |  |  (downup tr)
|  |  |  |  (downup t)
|  |  |  |  (t)
|  |  |  (tr t tr)
|  |  (tra tr t tr tra)
|  (trac tra tr t tr tra trac)
(trace trac tra tr t tr tra trac trace)
</CODE></SMALL>(TRACE TRAC TRA TR T TR TRA TRAC TRACE) </PRE> 

<P>When a procedure calls itself recursively, depending on the <A
NAME="g10"></A><A NAME="g11"></A>phase of the moon,<sup>*</sup> Scheme may
indent the trace display to show the levels of procedure calling, and draw a
line of vertical bars (&quot;<CODE>|</CODE>&quot;) from a procedure's
invocation to its return value below.  This is so you can look at a procedure
invocation and see what value it returned, or vice versa.

<p><small><small><sup>*</sup> That's computer science slang for "depending on
a mumber of factors that I consider too complicated to bother explaining" or
"depending on a number of factors that I don't understand myself."  Some
computer systems automatically print the phase of the moon on program
listings as an aid for programmers with "POM-dependent" programs.  What we
meant in this case is that it depends both on your vversion of Scheme and on
the exact form of your recursive procedure.</small></small>
 
<P>How does the trace help us understand what is going on in the recursion?
First, by reading the trace results from top to bottom, you can see
the actual sequence of events when the computer is carrying out your
Scheme program.  For example, you can see that we start trying to figure
out <CODE>(downup 'trace)</CODE>; the first thing printed is the line that says
we're starting that computation.  But, before we get a result from that,
four more <CODE>downup</CODE> computations have to begin.  The one that begins
last finishes first, returning <CODE>(t)</CODE>; then another one returns a value;
the one that started first is the last to return.
 
<P>You can also read the trace horizontally instead of vertically, focusing
on the levels of indentation.  If you do this, then instead of a sequence
of independent events (such-and-such starts, such-and-such returns a value)
you see the <EM>inclusion</EM> of processes within other ones.  The
smallest <CODE>downup</CODE> invocation is entirely inside the next-smallest
one, and so on.  The initial invocation of <CODE>downup</CODE> includes all of
the others.
 
<P>Perhaps you're thinking that <CODE>downup</CODE>'s pattern of inclusion is the only
one possible for recursive procedures.  That is, perhaps you're thinking that
every invocation includes exactly one smaller invocation, and <EM>that</EM> 
one includes a yet-smaller one, and so on.  But actually the pattern can be
more complicated.  Here's an example.  The <EM><A NAME="g12"></A><A NAME="g13"></A>Fibonacci numbers</EM> are a sequence of numbers in which the first
two numbers are 1 and each number after that is the sum of the two before
it:
 
<P><CENTER>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...</CENTER> 
<P> (They're named after
<A NAME="g14"></A>Leonardo Pisano.  You'd think they'd be called &quot;Pisano numbers,&quot;
but Leonardo had a kind of alias, Leonardo Fibonacci, just to confuse
people.)  Here's a procedure to compute the <EM>n</EM>th Fibonacci number:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g15"></A>fib n)
  (if (&lt;= n 2)
      1
      (+ (fib (- n 1))
         (fib (- n 2)))))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Here's a trace of computing the fourth Fibonacci number:
 
<PRE>&gt; (fib 4)
<SMALL><CODE>(fib 4)
|  (fib 2)
|  1
|  (fib 3)
|  |  (fib 1)
|  |  1
|  |  (fib 2)
|  |  1
|  2
3
</CODE></SMALL>3
</PRE> 
 
<P>(By the way, this trace demonstrates that in the dialect of
Scheme we used, the argument subexpressions of the <CODE>+</CODE> expression in
<CODE>fib</CODE> are evaluated from right to left, because the smaller <CODE>fib</CODE> 
arguments come before the larger ones in the trace.)
 
<P>As you can see, we still have invocations within other invocations, but the
pattern is not as simple as in the <CODE>downup</CODE> case.  If you're having
trouble making sense of this pattern, go back to thinking about the problem
in terms of little people; who hires whom?
