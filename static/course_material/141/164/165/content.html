The crowning achievement of the little-people model
is explaining recursion.  Remember that every time you call a procedure, a
little person is hired to compute the result.  If you want to know <CODE>(+ 2 (+ 3 4))</CODE>, there are two separate plus specialists involved.
 
<P>When we used the combining method, it was probably clear that it's okay
for <CODE>downup3</CODE> to invoke <CODE>downup2</CODE>, and for <CODE>downup2</CODE> to invoke
<CODE>downup1</CODE>.  But it probably felt like magic when we combined these
numbered procedures into a single <CODE>downup</CODE> procedure that calls <EM>itself.</EM> You may have thought, &quot;How can <CODE>downup</CODE> do all the different
tasks at once without getting confused?&quot; The little-people model answers
this question by showing that tasks are done by procedure <EM>invocations,</EM> not by procedures.  Each little person handles one task,
even though several little people are carrying out the same procedure.  The
procedure is just a set of instructions; someone has to carry out the
instructions.
 
<P>So what happens when we want to know <CODE>(downup 'smile)</CODE>?  We hire Donna,
a <CODE>downup</CODE> specialist, and she substitutes <CODE>smile</CODE> for <CODE>wd</CODE> in
the body of <CODE>downup</CODE>, leaving her with
 
<P><PRE>(if (= (count 'smile) 1)
    (se 'smile)
    (se 'smile (downup (bl 'smile)) 'smile)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>We'll leave out the details about hiring the <CODE>if</CODE>, <CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>count</CODE>,
and <CODE>bl</CODE> specialists in this example, so Donna ends up with
 
<P><PRE>(se 'smile (downup 'smil) 'smile)
</PRE> 
 
<P>In order to evaluate this, Donna needs to know <CODE>(downup 'smil)</CODE>.  She hires David, another <CODE>downup</CODE> specialist, and
waits for his answer.
 
<P>David's <CODE>wd</CODE> is <CODE>smil</CODE>. He substitutes <CODE>smil</CODE> for <CODE>wd</CODE> in the
body of <CODE>downup</CODE>, and <EM>he</EM> gets
 
<P><PRE>(if (= (count 'smil) 1)
    (se 'smil)
    (se 'smil (downup (bl 'smil)) 'smil)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>After some uninteresting work, David has
 
<P><PRE>(se 'smil (downup 'smi) 'smil)
</PRE> 
 
<P>and he hires Dennis to compute <CODE>(downup 'smi)</CODE>.  There are
now three little people, all in the middle of some <CODE>downup</CODE> computation,
and each of them is working on a different word.
 
<P>Dennis substitutes <CODE>smi</CODE> for <CODE>wd</CODE>, and ends up with
 
<P><PRE>(se 'smi (downup 'sm) 'smi)
</PRE> 
 
<P>He hires Derek to compute <CODE>(downup 'sm)</CODE>.  Derek needs to
compute
 
<P><PRE>(se 'sm (downup 's) 'sm)
</PRE> 
 
<P>Derek hires Dexter to find <CODE>downup</CODE> of <CODE>s</CODE>. Now we have to
think carefully about the substitution again.  Dexter substitutes his
actual argument, <CODE>s</CODE>, for his formal parameter <CODE>wd</CODE>, and ends up
with
 
<P><PRE>(if (= (count 's) 1)
    (se 's)
    (se 's (downup (bl 's)) 's)))
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>Count</CODE> of <CODE>s</CODE> <EM>is</EM> 1.  So Dexter hires Simi,
a <CODE>sentence</CODE> specialist, who returns <CODE>(s)</CODE>.  Dexter returns the same
answer to Derek.
 
<P>Derek, you will recall, is trying to compute
 
<P><PRE>(se 'sm (downup 's) 'sm)
</PRE> 
 
<P>and now he knows the value of <CODE>(downup 's)</CODE>.  So he hires
Savita to compute
 
<P><PRE>(se 'sm '(s) 'sm)
</PRE> 
 
<P>and the answer is <CODE>(sm s sm)</CODE>.  Derek returns this answer to
Dennis.  By the way, do you remember what question Derek was hired to
answer?  Dennis wanted to know <CODE>(downup 'sm)</CODE>.  The answer Derek gave
him was <CODE>(sm s sm)</CODE>, which <EM>is</EM> <CODE>downup</CODE> of <CODE>sm</CODE>.  Pretty
neat, huh?

<P> 
Dennis hires Sigrid to compute
 
<P><PRE>(se 'smi '(sm s sm) 'smi)
</PRE> 
 
<P>and returns <CODE>(smi sm s sm smi)</CODE> to David.  His answer is the
correct value of <CODE>(downup 'smi)</CODE>.  David returns
 
<P><PRE>(smil smi sm s sm smi smil)
</PRE> 
 
<P>to Donna, who has been waiting all this time to evaluate
 
<P><PRE>(se 'smile (downup 'smil) 'smile)
</PRE> 
 
<P>Her waiting microseconds are over.  She hires a <CODE>sentence</CODE> 
specialist and returns
 
<P><PRE>(smile smil smi sm s sm smi smil smile)
</PRE> 
 
<P><P> 
If you have a group of friends whose names all start with &quot;D,&quot; you can try
this out yourselves.  The rules of the game are pretty simple.  Remember
that each one of you can have only one single value for <CODE>wd</CODE>.  Also,
only one of you is in charge of the game at any point.  When you hire
somebody, that new person is in charge of the game until he or she tells you
the answer to his or her question.  If some of you have names that don't
start with &quot;D,&quot; you can be specialists in <CODE>sentence</CODE> or <CODE>butlast</CODE> 
or something.  Play hard, play fair, nobody hurt.
