1.  For this lab you'll need three people, each on a separate workstation.

<p>
One person should choose to be the server, and should do this:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (load "&#126;cs61a/lib/im-server.scm")
&#62; (im-server-start)

</pre></tt>

<p>
Make a note of the IP address and port number that this prints!

<p>
The other people will be clients.  They should do this:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (load "&#126;cs61a/lib/im-client.scm")
&#62; (im-enroll "123.45.67.89" 6543)    ; use actual numbers from server!

</pre></tt>

<p>
but using the server's IP address instead of 123.45.67.89 and the server's
port number instead of 6543.  (Note that the IP address must be enclosed
in quotation marks.)

<p>
The clients can then send each other messages:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (im 'cs61a-xy "Hi there, how are you?")

</pre></tt>

<p>
The messages can't include more than one line.

<p>
A client can leave the IM system by running

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (im-exit)

</pre></tt>

<p>
The server can quit (which disconnects all the clients) with

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (im-server-close)

</pre></tt>

<p>

<p>
2.  Start on the homework, since it'll be easier to
test your work with several people.
