<b>CS 61A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Week 10</b>
<p>
Topic: client/server, concurrency
<p>
<b>Reading:</b>
Abelson &amp; Sussman, Section 3.4
<p>
<b>Homework:</b>
<p>
These exercises use the Instant Message program, found in the following files:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#126;cs61a/lib/im-client.scm
&#126;cs61a/lib/im-server.scm
&#126;cs61a/lib/im-common.scm

</pre></tt>

<p>
1.  Invent the capability to send a message to a list of clients as
well as to a single client.  Do this entirely in the client program,
so what actually goes to the server is multiple requests.

<p>
2.  Invent the capability to broadcast a message to every client.
Do this by inventing a <tt>broadcast</tt> command that the server understands.

<p>
3.  Could #1 have been done with the server doing part of the work?
Could #2 have been done entirely in the client code?  Compare the
virtues of the two approaches.

<p>
4.  Invent the capability of refusing messages from specific people.
The sender of a refused message should be notified of the refusal.
Decide whether to do it entirely in the client or with the server's
cooperation, and explain why.

<p>
5.  Why is the 3-way handshake necessary when connecting to the server?

<b>Extra for experts:</b>
<p>
Using the Instant Message program as a starting point, write a mail
server and client.  The mail server should maintain a database of messages
for all users.  (This can just be a list; don't worry about efficient lookup.)
The client should be able to do the following:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>(mail username message)
(get-mail)

</pre></tt>

<p>
<tt>Get-mail</tt> should return a list of messages, which should be deleted
from the server.

<p>
If you want, you can improve this in several ways:  Make deletion from the
server be explicitly requested by the client, invent a subject header (another
argument to <tt>mail</tt>) and have the client show just headers in <tt>
get-mail</tt> and provide another command to read the text of a specific message,
and so on.
