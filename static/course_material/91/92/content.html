> <b>Client/server programming paradigm</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Before networks, most programs ran on a single computer.  Today it's common
for programs to involve cooperation between computers.  The usual reason is
that you want to run a program on your computer that uses data located
elsewhere.  A common example is using a browser on
your computer to read a web page stored somewhere else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To make this cooperation possible, <i>two </i> programs are actually
required:&nbsp;the <i>client </i> program on your personal computer and the <i>
server </i> program on the remote computer.  Sometimes the client and the server
are written by a single group, but often someone publishes a <i>standard </i>
document that allows any client to work with any server that follows the same
standard.  For example, you can use Mozilla, Netscape, or Internet Explorer to
read most web pages, because they all follow standards set by the World Wide Web
Consortium.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For this course we provide a sample client/server system, implementing a
simple Instant Message protocol.  The files are available in

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>&#126;cs61a/lib/im-client.scm
&#126;cs61a/lib/im-server.scm

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To use them, you must first start a server.  Load <tt>im-server.scm</tt> and
call the procedure <tt>im-server-start</tt>; it will print the IP (Internet
Protocol) address of the
machine you're using, along with another number, the <i>port </i> assigned
to the server.  Clients will use these numbers to connect to the server.
Port numbers are important because there might be more than one server program
running on the same computer, and also to keep track of connections from more
than one client.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(Why don't you need these numbers when using "real" network software?  You
don't need to know the IP address because your client software knows how to
connect to <i>nameservers </i> to translate the host names you give it into
addresses.  And most client/server protocols use fixed, <i>registered </i>
port numbers that are built into the software.  For example, web browsers use
port 80, while the <tt>ssh</tt> protocol you may use to connect to your class
account from home uses port 22.  But our sample client/server protocol doesn't
have a registered port number, so the operating system assigns a port to the
server when you start it.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To connect to the server, load <tt>im-client.scm</tt> and call <tt>im-enroll</tt>
with the IP address and port number as arguments.  (Details are in this week's
lab assignment.)  Then use the <tt>im</tt> procedure to send a message to other
people connected to the same server.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This simple implementation uses the Scheme interpreter as its user interface;
you send messages by typing Scheme expressions.  Commercial Instant Message
clients have a more ornate user interface, that accept mouse clicks in windows
listing other clients to specify the recipient of a message.  But our version
is realistic in the way it uses the network; the IM client on your home
computer connects to a particular port on a particular server in order to use
the facility.  (The only difference is that a large commercial IM system will
have more than one server; your client connects to the one nearest you, and
the servers send messages among themselves to give the illusion of one big
server to which everyone is connected.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the news these days, client/server protocols are sometimes contrasted with
another approach called <i>peer-to-peer </i> networking, such as file-sharing
systems like Napster and Kazaa.  The distinction is social rather than
strictly technical.  In each individual transaction using a peer-to-peer
protocol, one machine is acting as a server and the other as a client.  What
makes it peer-to-peer networking is that any machine using the protocol can
play either role, unlike the more usual commercial networking idea in which
rich companies operate servers and ordinary people operate clients.

<b>Internet primitives in STk</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
STk defines sockets, on systems which support them, as first class objects.
Sockets permit processes to communicate even if they are on different
machines. Sockets are useful for creating client-server applications.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(make-client-socket hostname port-number)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>make-client-socket</tt> returns a new socket object. This socket establishes
a link between the running application listening on port <tt>port-number</tt> of
<tt>hostname</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket? socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns <tt>#t</tt> if <tt>socket</tt> is a socket, otherwise returns <tt>#f</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-host-name socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns a string which contains the name of the distant host attached to <tt>
socket</tt>. If <tt>socket</tt> was created with <tt>make-client-socket</tt>, this
procedure returns the official name of the distant machine used for
connection. If <tt>socket</tt> was created with <tt>make-server-socket</tt>, this
function returns the official name of the client connected to the socket. If
no client has yet used the socket, this function returns <tt>#f</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-host-address socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns a string which contains the IP number of the distant host attached to
<tt>socket</tt>. If <tt>socket</tt> was created with <tt>make-client-socket</tt>, this
procedure returns the IP number of the distant machine used for connection. If
<tt>socket</tt> was created with <tt>make-server-socket</tt>, this function returns
the address of the client connected to the socket. If no client has yet used
the socket, this function returns <tt>#f</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-local-address socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns a string which contains the IP number of the local host attached to
<tt>socket</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-port-number socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns the integer number of the port used for <tt>socket</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-input socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-output socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns the port associated for reading or writing with the program connected
with <tt>socket</tt>. If no connection has been established, these functions
return <tt>#f</tt>. The following example shows how to make a client socket.
Here we create a socket on port 13 of the machine <tt>kaolin.unice.fr</tt>.
[Port 13 is generally used for testing: making a connection to it
returns the distant system's idea of the time of day.]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(let ((s (make-client-socket "kaolin.unice.fr" 13)))
  (format #t "Time is: &#126;A'134n" (read-line (socket-input s)))
  (socket-shutdown s))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(make-server-socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(make-server-socket port-number)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>make-server-socket</tt> returns a new socket object.  If <tt>port-number</tt> is
specified, the socket listens on the specified port; otherwise, the
communication port is chosen by the system.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-accept-connection socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>socket-accept-connection</tt> waits for a client connection on the given
socket. If no client is already waiting for a connection, this procedure
blocks its caller; otherwise, the first connection request on the queue of
pending connections is connected to socket. This procedure must be called on a
server socket created with <tt>make-server-socket</tt>. The return value of <tt>
socket-accept-connection</tt> is undefined.  The following example is a simple
server which waits for a connection on the port 1234.  Once the connection
with the distant program is established, we read a line on the input port
associated to the socket and we write the length of this line on its output
port.  [Under Unix, you can simply connect to listening socket with the telnet
command. With the given example, this can be achieved by typing the
command

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>telnet localhost 1234

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
in a shell window.]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(let ((s (make-server-socket 1234)))
  (socket-accept-connection s)
  (let ((l (read-line (socket-input s))))
    (format (socket-output s) "Length is: &#126;A'134n" (string-length l))
    (flush (socket-output s)))
  (socket-shutdown s))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-shutdown socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-shutdown socket close)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>Socket-shutdown</tt> shuts down the connection associated to <tt>socket</tt>.
<tt>Close</tt> is a boolean; it indicates if the socket must be closed or not,
when the connection is destroyed. Closing the socket forbids further
connections on the same port with the <tt>socket-accept-connection</tt>
procedure.  Omitting a value for <tt>close</tt> implies closing the socket. The
return value of <tt>socket-shutdown</tt> is undefined.  The following example
shows a simple server:  when there is a new connection on the port number
1234, the server displays the first line sent to it by the client, discards
the others and goes back waiting for further client connections.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(let ((s (make-server-socket 1234)))
  (let loop ()
    (socket-accept-connections)
    (format #t &#207;'ve read: &#126;A'134n" (read-line (socket-input s)))
    (socket-shutdown s #f)
    (loop)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-down? socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns <tt>#t</tt> if socket has been previously closed with socket-shutdown.
It returns <tt>#f</tt> otherwise.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(socket-dup socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Returns a copy of <tt>socket</tt>. The original and the copy socket can be used
interchangeably. However, if a new connection is accepted on one socket, the
characters exchanged on this socket are not visible on the other socket.
Duplicating a socket is useful when a server must accept multiple simultaneous
connections. The following example creates a server listening on port 1234.
This server is duplicated and, once two clients are present, a message is sent
on both connections.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define s1 (make-server-socket 1234)) 
(define s2 (socket-dup s1))
(socket-accept-connection s1) 
(socket-accept-connection s2) ;; blocks until two clients are present
(display "Hello,'134n" (socket-output s1))
(display "world'134n" (socket-output s2))
(flush (socket-output s1))
(flush (socket-output s2))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(when-socket-ready socket handler)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><tt>(when-socket-ready socket)</tt></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->00

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Defines a handler for <tt>socket</tt>. The handler is a thunk which is executed
when a connection is available on socket. If the special value <tt>#f</tt> is
provided as <tt>handler</tt>, the current handler for socket is deleted.  If a
handler is provided, the value returned by <tt>when-socket-ready</tt> is
undefined.  Otherwise, it returns the handler currently associated to <tt>
socket</tt>.  This procedure, in conjunction with <tt>socket-dup</tt>, permits
building multiple-client servers which work asynchronously. Such a server is
shown below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define p (make-server-socket 1234))
(when-socket-ready p
  (let ((count 0)) 
    (lambda ()
      (set! count (+ count 1))
      (register-connection (socket-dup p) count))))
(define register-connection
  (let ((sockets '()))
    (lambda (s cnt)
      ;; Accept connection
      (socket-accept-connection s)
      ;; Save socket somewhere to avoid GC problems
      (set! sockets (cons s sockets))
      ;; Create a handler for reading inputs from this new connection
      (let ((in (socket-input s))
	    (out (socket-output s)))
	(when-port-readable in
          (lambda ()
	    (let ((l (read-line in)))
	      (if (eof-object? l)
		  ;; delete current handler
		  (when-port-readable in #f)
		  ;; Just write the line read on the socket
		  (begin (format out &#214;n #&#126;A -&#62; &#126;A'134n" cnt l)
			 (flush out))))))))))

> <b>Concurrency</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To work with the ideas in this section you should first

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(load "&#126;cs61a/lib/concurrent.scm")

</pre></tt>
in order to get the necessary Scheme extensions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Parallelism</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Many things we take for granted in ordinary programming become
problematic when there is any kind of parallelism involved.
These situations include

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />
<dl compact="compact">
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>
multiple processors (hardware) sharing data
</dd>
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>software multithreading (simulated parallelism)
</dd>
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>operating system input/output device handlers
</dd></dl><br />This is the most important topic in CS&nbsp;162, the operating
systems course; here in 61A we give only a brief introduction,
in the hope that when you see this topic for the second time
it'll be clearer as a result.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To see in simple terms what the problem is, think about the
Scheme expression

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(set! x (+ x 1))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As you'll learn in more detail in 61C, Scheme translates this
into a sequence of instructions to your computer.  The details
depend on the particular computer model, but it'll be something
like this:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>   lw   $8, x          ; Load a Word from memory location x
                       ; into processor register number 8.
   addi $8, 1          ; Add the Immediate value 1 to the register.
   sw   $8, x          ; Store the Word from register 8 back
                       ; into memory location x.

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ordinarily we would expect this sequence of instructions to have
the desired effect.  If the value of <tt>x</tt> was 100 before these
instructions, it should be 101 after them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But imagine that this sequence of three instructions can be
interrupted by other events that come in the middle.  To be
specific, let's suppose that someone else is also trying to&nbsp;add 1 to <tt>x</tt>'s value.  Now we might have this sequence:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>my process                             other process
----                             -----

<div class="p"><!----></div>
lw   $8, x   [value is 100]
addi $8, 1   [value is 101]
                                       lw   $9, x   [value is 100]
                                       addi $9, 1   [value is 101]
                                       sw   $9, x   [stores 101]
sw   $8, x   [stores 101]

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The ultimate value of <tt>x</tt> will be 101, instead of the correct 102.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The general idea we need to solve this problem is the <i>critical section</i>,
which means a sequence of instructions that mustn't be interrupted.  The
three instructions starting with the load and ending with the store are
a critical section.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Actually, we don't have to say that these instructions can't be
interrupted; the only condition we must enforce is that they can't
be interrupted by another process that uses the variable <tt>x</tt>.
It's okay if another process wants to add 1 to <tt>y</tt> meanwhile.
So we'd like to be able to say something like

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>reserve x
lw      $8, x
addi    $8, 1
sw      $8, x
release x

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Levels of Abstraction</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Computers don't really have instructions quite like <tt>reserve</tt>
and <tt>release</tt>, but we'll see that they do provide similar
mechanisms.  A typical programming environment includes concurrency
control mechanisms at three levels of abstraction:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>SICP name              What's protected           Provided by
---              ------           ----

<div class="p"><!----></div>
serializer             high level abstraction     programming language
                        (procedure, object, ...)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
mutex                  critical section           operating system

<div class="p"><!----></div>
test-and-set!          one atomic                 hardware
                        state transition

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The serializer and the mutex are, in SICP, abstract data types.  There is
a constructor <tt>make-serializer</tt> that's implemented using a mutex, and a
constructor <tt>make-mutex</tt> that's implemented using <tt>test-and-set!</tt>,
which is a (simulated, in our case) hardware instruction.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Serializers</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  For now, let's look at how this idea can be expressed
at a higher level of abstraction, in a Scheme program.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define x-protector (make-serializer))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define protected-increment-x (x-protector (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&#62; x
100
&#62; (protected-increment-x)
&#62; x
101

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We introduce an abstraction called a <i>serializer</i>.  This is a procedure
that takes as its argument another procedure (call it <tt>proc</tt>).  The
serializer returns a new procedure (call it <tt>protected-proc</tt>).  When
invoked, <tt>protected-proc</tt> invokes <tt>proc</tt>, but only if the <i>
same </i> serializer is not already in use by another protected procedure.
<tt>Proc</tt> can have any number of arguments, and <tt>protected-proc</tt> will
take the same arguments and return the same value.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There can be many different serializers, all in operation at once, but each
one can't be doing two things at once.  So if we say

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define x-protector (make-serializer))
(define y-protector (make-serializer))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(parallel-execute (x-protector (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1))))
                  (y-protector (lambda () (set! y (+ y 1)))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
then both tasks can run at the same time; it doesn't matter
how their machine instructions are interleaved.  But if we
say

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(parallel-execute (x-protector (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1))))
                  (x-protector (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
then, since we're using the same serializer in both tasks, the
serializer will ensure that they don't overlap in time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've introduced a new primitive procedure, <tt>parallel-execute</tt>.  It
takes any number of arguments, each of which is a
procedure of no arguments, and invokes them them, in
parallel rather than in sequence.  (This isn't a standard part
of Scheme, but an extension for this section of the textbook.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You may be wondering about the need for all those <tt>(lambda&nbsp;()...)</tt>
notations.  Since a serializer isn't a special form, it can't take
an expression as argument.  Instead we must give it a procedure
that it can invoke.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Programming Considerations</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Even with serializers, it's not easy to do a good job of writing
programs that deal successfully with concurrency.  In fact, all of
the operating systems in widespread use today have bugs in this
area; Unix systems, for example, are expected to crash every
month or two because of concurrency bugs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To make the discussion concrete, let's think about an airline
reservation system, which serves thousands of simultaneous
users around the world.  Here are the things that can go wrong:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> <b>Incorrect results.</b>  The worst problem is if the
same seat is reserved for two different people.  Just as in the
case of adding 1 to <tt>x</tt>, the reservation system must first
find a vacant seat, then mark that seat as occupied.  That sequence
of reading and then modifying the database must be protected.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> <b>Inefficiency.</b>  One very simple way to ensure
correct results is to use a single serializer to protect the
entire reservation database, so that only one person could make
a request at a time.  But this is an unacceptable solution;
thousands of people are waiting to reserve seats, mostly not
for the same flight.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> <b>Deadlock.</b>  Suppose that someone wants to travel
to a city for which there is no direct flight.  We must make
sure that we can reserve a seat on flight A and a seat on
connecting flight B on the same day, before we commit to either
reservation.  This probably means that we need to use <i>two </i>
serializers at the same time, one for each flight.  Suppose we
say something like

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(serializer-A (serializer-B (lambda () ...))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Meanwhile someone else says

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(serializer-B (serializer-A (lambda () ...))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The timing could work out so that we get serializer A, the
other person gets serializer B, and then we are each stuck
waiting for the other one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> <b>Unfairness.</b>  This isn't an issue in every
situation, but sometimes you want to avoid a solution to the
deadlock problem that always gives a certain process priority
over some other one.  If the high-priority process is greedy,
the lower-priority process might never get its turn at the
shared data.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Implementing Serializers</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A serializer is a high-level abstraction.  How do we make it work?
Here is an <i>incorrect </i> attempt to implement serializers:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/3.4/bad-serial.scm

This is a little complicated, so concentrate on the important parts.
In particular, never mind about the <i>scheduling </i> aspect of
parallelism-how we can ask this process to wait a while before
trying again if the serializer is already in use.  And never mind
the stuff about <tt>apply</tt>, which is needed only so that we can
serialize procedures with any number of arguments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The part to focus on is this:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>	(if in-use?
	    .......         ; wait and try again
	    (begin
	     (set! in-use #t)        ; Don't let anyone else in.
	     (apply proc args)       ; Call the original procedure.
	     (set! in-use #f)))      ; Finished, let others in again.

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The intent of this code is that it first checks to see if the
serializer is already in use.  If not, we claim the serializer
by setting <tt>in-use</tt> true, do our job, and then release the
serializer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The problem is that this sequence of events is subject to the
same parallelism problems as the procedure we're trying to protect!
What if we check the value of <tt>in-use</tt>, discover that it's false,
and right at that moment another process sneaks in and grabs the
serializer?  In order to make this work we'd have to have another
serializer protecting this one, and a third serializer protecting
the second one, and so on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>There is no easy way to avoid this problem by clever programming
tricks within the competing processes</i>.  We need help at the level
of the underlying machinery that provides the parallelism: the
hardware and/or the operating system.  That underlying level must
provide a <i>guaranteed atomic </i> operation with which we can
test the old value of <tt>in-use</tt> and change it to a new value
with no possibility of another process intervening.  (It turns out that
there is a very tricky software algorithm to generate guaranteed
atomic test-and-set, but in practice, there is almost always hardware
support for parallelism.  Look up "Peterson's algorithm" in Wikipedia
if you want to see the software solution.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The textbook assumes the existence of a procedure called
<tt>test-and-set!</tt>&nbsp;with this guarantee of atomicity.  Although
there is a pseudo-implementation on page 312, that procedure
won't really work, for the same reason that my pseudo-implementation
of <tt>make-serializer</tt> won't work.  What you have to imagine
is that <tt>test-and-set!</tt>&nbsp;is a single instruction in the
computer's hardware, comparable to the Load Word instructions
and so on that I started with.  (This is a realistic assumption;
modern computers do provide some such hardware mechanism,
precisely for the reasons we're discussing now.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>The Mutex</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The book uses an intermediate level of abstraction between
the serializer and the atomic hardware capability, called
a <i>mutex</i>.  What's the difference between a mutex and
a serializer?  The serializer provides, as an abstraction,
a protected operation, without requiring the programmer to
think about the mechanism by which it's protected.  The
mutex exposes the sequence of events.  Just as my incorrect
implementation said

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>    (set! in-use #t)
    (apply proc args)
    (set! in-use #f)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
the correct version uses a similar sequence

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>    (mutex 'acquire)
    (apply proc args)
    (mutex 'release)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By the way, all of the versions in these notes have another bug;
I've simplified the discussion by ignoring the problem of return
values.  We want the value returned by <tt>protected-proc</tt> to be
the same as the value returned by the original <tt>proc</tt>, even
though the call to <tt>proc</tt> isn't the last step.  Therefore
the correct implementation is

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>    (mutex 'acquire)
    (let ((result (apply proc args)))
      (mutex 'release)
      result)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
as in the book's implementation on page 311.
