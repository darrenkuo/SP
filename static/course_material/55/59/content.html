> Write a procedure <tt>substitute</tt> that takes three arguments:&nbsp;a
list, an <i>old </i> word, and a <i>new </i> word.  It should return
a copy of the list, but with every occurrence of the old word
replaced by the new word, even in sublists.  For example:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (substitute '((lead guitar) (bass guitar) (rhythm guitar) drums)
	      'guitar 'axe)
((lead axe) (bass axe) (rhythm axe) drums)

</pre></tt>

<p>
<font face="symbol"></font
> Now write <tt>substitute2</tt> that takes a list, a <i>list </i> of
old words, and a <i>list </i> of new words; the last two lists should be
the same length.  It should return a copy of the first argument, but with
each word that occurs in the second argument replaced by the
corresponding word of the third argument:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (substitute2 '((4 calling birds) (3 french hens) (2 turtle doves))
               '(1 2 3 4) '(one two three four))
((four calling birds) (three french hens) (two turtle doves))

</pre></tt>

<b>Extra for experts:</b>
<p>
Write the procedure <tt>cxr-function</tt> that takes as its argument a word
starting with <tt>c</tt>, ending with <tt>r</tt>, and having a string of letters
<tt>a</tt> and/or <tt>d</tt> in between, such as <tt>cdddadaadar</tt>.  It should
return the corresponding function.

Abelson &amp; Sussman, exercise 2.6.  Besides addition, invent multiplication and
exponentiation of nonnegative integers.  If you're <i>really </i>
enthusiastic, see if you can invent subtraction.  (Remember, the rule of this
game is that you have only <tt>lambda</tt> as a starting point.)  Read <tt>
&#126;cs61a/lib/church-hint</tt> for some suggestions.
