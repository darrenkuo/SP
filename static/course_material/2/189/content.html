<P><B>3.1</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Translate the arithmetic expressions (3+4)&times;5 and 3+(4&times;5)
into Scheme expressions, and into plumbing diagrams.
 
<P><B>3.9</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression <CODE>(+ 8 2)</CODE> has the value <CODE>10</CODE>.  It is a compound
expression made up of three atoms.  For this problem, write five other
Scheme expressions whose values are also the number ten:
 
<P><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">An atom
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">Another compound expression made up of three atoms
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">A compound expression made up of four atoms
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">A compound expression made up of an atom and two compound subexpressions
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">Any other kind of expression

<P><B>4.4</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the following procedure definitions has an error of some kind.
Say what's wrong and why, and fix it:
 
<P><PRE>(define (sphere-volume r)
  (* (/ 4 3) 3.141592654)
  (* r r r))
 
(define (next x)
  (x + 1))
 
(define (square)
  (* x x))
 
(define (triangle-area triangle)
  (* 0.5 base height))
 
(define (sum-of-squares (square x) (square y))
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
<B>4.6</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Define a procedure <CODE>fourth</CODE> that computes the fourth power of its
argument.  Do this two ways, first using the multiplication function,
and then using <CODE>square</CODE> and not (directly) using multiplication.
 
<P> 
<B>4.8</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scientific notation&quot; is a way to represent very small or very large
numbers by combining a medium-sized number with a power of 10.  For example,
5&times;10<SUP><SMALL>7</SMALL></SUP> represents the number 50000000, while 3.26&times;10<SUP><SMALL>-9</SMALL></SUP> 
represents 0.00000000326 in scientific notation.  Write a procedure
<CODE>scientific</CODE> that takes two arguments, a number and an exponent of 10,
and returns the corresponding value:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (scientific 7 3)
7000
 
&gt; (scientific 42 -5)
0.00042
</PRE> 
 
<P>Some versions of Scheme represent fractions in <EM>a</EM>/<EM>b</EM> form, and
some use scientific notation, so you might see <CODE>21/50000</CODE> or <CODE>4.2E-4</CODE> 
as the result of the last example instead of <CODE>0.00042</CODE>, but these are
the same value.
 
<P>(A harder problem for hotshots:  Can you write procedures that go in the
other direction?  So you'd have
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (sci-coefficient 7000)
7
 
&gt; (sci-exponent 7000)
3
</PRE> 
 
<P>You might find the primitive procedures <CODE>log</CODE> and <CODE>floor</CODE> helpful.)
