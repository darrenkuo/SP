Since a little person can't do his or her job until all of the necessary
subexpressions have been evaluated by other little people, we can &quot;fast
forward&quot; this process by skipping the parts about &quot;Alice waits for Bernie
and Cordelia&quot; and starting with the completion of the smaller tasks by the
lesser little people.
 
<P>To keep track of which result goes into which larger computation, you can
write down a complicated expression and then <EM>rewrite</EM> it repeatedly,
each time replacing some small expression with a simpler expression
that has the same value.

<P>In each line of the diagram, the boxed expression
is the one that will be replaced with its value on the following line.
 
<P>If you like, you can save some steps by evaluating <EM>several</EM> small
expressions from one line to the next:
 
<P><PRE>(+ (* (- 10 7) (+ 4 1)) (- 15 (/ 12 3)) 17)
(+ (* 3        5      ) (- 15 4       ) 17)
(+ 15                   11              17)
