<P>One of the biggest problems that beginning Lisp programmers have comes
from trying to read a program from left to right, rather than thinking about
it in terms of expressions and subexpressions.  For example,
 
<P><PRE>(square (cos 3))
</PRE> 
 
<P><EM>doesn't</EM> mean &quot;square three, then take the cosine of
the answer you get.&quot; Instead, as you know, it means that the argument to
<CODE>square</CODE> is the return value from <CODE>(cos 3)</CODE>.
 
<P>Another big problem that people have is thinking that Scheme cares
about the spaces, tabs, line breaks, and other &quot;white space&quot; in their
Scheme programs.  We've been indenting our expressions to illustrate the way
that subexpressions line up underneath each other.  But to Scheme,
<A NAME="g16"></A> 
 
<P><PRE>(+ (* 2 (/ 14 7) 3) (/ (* (- (* 3 5) 3) (+ 1
1)) (- (* 4 3) (* 3 2))) (- 15 18))
</PRE> 
 
<P>means the same thing as
 
<P><PRE>(+ (* 2 (/ 14 7) 3)
   (/ (* (- (* 3 5) 3) (+ 1 1))
      (- (* 4 3) (* 3 2)))
   (- 15 18))
</PRE> 
 
<P>So in this expression:
 
<P><PRE>(+ (* 3 (sqrt 49)                            ;; weirdly formatted
   (/ 12 4)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>there aren't two arguments to <CODE>+</CODE>, even though it looks that
way if you think about the indenting.  What Scheme does is look at the
parentheses, and if you examine these carefully, you'll see that there are
three arguments to <CODE>*</CODE>: the atom <CODE>3</CODE>, the compound expression <CODE>(sqrt 49)</CODE>, and the compound expression <CODE>(/ 12 4)</CODE>.  (And there's only one
argument to <CODE>+</CODE>.)
 
<P>A consequence of Scheme's not caring about white space is that when you
hit the return key, Scheme might not do anything.  If you're in the middle
of an expression, Scheme waits until you're done typing the entire thing
before it evaluates what you've typed.  This is fine if your program is
correct, but if you type this in:
 
<P><PRE>(+ (* 3 4)
   (/ 8 2)                              ; note missing right paren
</PRE> 
 
<P>then <EM>nothing</EM> will happen.  Even if you type forever, until
you close the open parenthesis next to the <CODE>+</CODE> sign, Scheme will still
be reading an expression.  So if Scheme seems to be ignoring you, try typing
a zillion close parentheses.  (You'll probably get an error message about
too many parentheses, but after that, Scheme should start paying attention
again.)
 
<P>You might get into the same sort of trouble if you have a double-quote
mark (<CODE>&quot;</CODE>) in your program.  Everything inside a pair of quotation marks
is treated as one single <EM>string.</EM> We'll explain more about
strings later.  For now, if your program has a stray quotation mark, like
this:
 
<P><PRE>(+ (* 3 &quot; 4)                            ; note extra quote mark
   (/ 8 2))
</PRE> 
 
<P>then you can get into the same predicament of typing and having
Scheme ignore you.  (Once you type the second quotation mark, you may still
need some close parentheses, since the ones you type inside a string
don't count.)
 
<P>One other way that Scheme might seem to be ignoring you comes from the
fact that you don't get a new Scheme prompt until you type in an expression
and it's evaluated.  So if you just hit the <CODE>return</CODE> or <CODE>enter</CODE> key
without typing anything, most versions of Scheme won't print a new prompt.
