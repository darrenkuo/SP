<P>You may not have realized it, but inside your computer there are thousands
of little people.  Each of them is a specialist in one particular
Scheme procedure.  The head little person, Alonzo, is in charge of the
read-eval-print loop.
 
<P> 
When you enter an expression, such as
 
<P><PRE>(- (+ 5 8) (+ 2 4))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Alonzo reads it, hires other little people to help him evaluate
it, and finally prints <CODE>7</CODE>, its value.  We're going to focus on the
evaluation step.
 
<P> 
Three little people work together to evaluate the expression: a minus person
and two plus people.  (To make this account easier to read, we're using the
ordinary English words &quot;minus&quot; and &quot;plus&quot; to refer to the procedures
whose Scheme names are <CODE>-</CODE> and <CODE>+</CODE>.  Don't be confused by this and
try to type <CODE>minus</CODE> to Scheme.)
 
<P>Since the overall expression is a subtraction, Alonzo hires Alice, the first
available minus specialist.  Here's how the little people evaluate the
expression:
 
<P><P><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">Alice wants to be given some numbers, so before she can do any work, she
complains to Alonzo that she wants to know which numbers to subtract.
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">Alonzo looks at the subexpressions that should provide Alice's
arguments, namely, <CODE>(+ 5 8)</CODE> and <CODE>(+ 2 4)</CODE>.  Since both of these are
addition problems, Alonzo hires two plus specialists, Bernie and Cordelia,
and tells them to report their results to Alice.
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">The first plus person, Bernie, also wants some numbers, so he asks
Alonzo for them.
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">Alonzo looks at the subexpressions of <CODE>(+ 5 8)</CODE> that should provide
Bernie's arguments, namely, <CODE>5</CODE> and <CODE>8</CODE>.  Since these are both
atomic, Alonzo can give them directly to Bernie.
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">Bernie adds his arguments, <CODE>5</CODE> and <CODE>8</CODE>, to get <CODE>13</CODE>.  He
does this in his head&mdash;we don't have to worry about how he knows how to
add; that's his job.
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">The second plus person, Cordelia, wants some arguments; Alonzo looks at
the subexpressions of <CODE>(+ 2 4)</CODE> and gives the <CODE>2</CODE> and <CODE>4</CODE> to
Cordelia.  She adds them, getting <CODE>6</CODE>.
 
</TABLE><TABLE><TR><TH align="right" valign="top">&bull;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD valign="top">Bernie and Cordelia hand their results to the waiting Alice, who can now
subtract them to get <CODE>7</CODE>.  She hands that result to Alonzo, who prints
it.
 
</TABLE><P> 
How does Alonzo know what's the argument to what?  That's what the grouping
of subexpressions with parentheses is about.  Since the plus expressions are
inside the minus expression, the plus people have to give their results to
the minus person.
 
<P>We've made it seem as if Bernie does his work before Cordelia does hers.  In
fact, the <EM><A NAME="g7"></A><A NAME="g8"></A>order of evaluation</EM> of the argument subexpressions
is not specified in Scheme; different implementations may do it in different
orders.  In particular, Cordelia might do her work before Bernie, or they
might even do their work at the same time, if we're using a <EM>parallel
processing</EM> computer.  However, it <EM>is</EM> important that both Bernie
and Cordelia finish their work before Alice can do hers.
 
<P>The entire call to <CODE>-</CODE> is itself a single expression; it could be a
part of an even larger expression:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (* (- (+ 5 8) (+ 2 4))
     (/ 10 2))
35
</PRE> 
 
<P>This says to multiply the numbers 7 and 5, except that instead of
saying 7 and 5 explicitly, we wrote expressions whose values are 7 and 5.
(By the way, we would say that the above expression has three
subexpressions, the <CODE>*</CODE> and the two arguments.  The argument
subexpressions, in turn, have their own subexpressions.  However, these
sub-subexpressions, such as <CODE>(+ 5 8)</CODE>, don't count as
subexpressions of the whole thing.)
 
<P>We can express this organization of little people more formally.  If
an expression is atomic, Scheme just knows the value.<A NAME="text3" HREF="#ft3">[3]</A> Otherwise, it is a compound
expression, so Scheme first evaluates all the subexpressions (in some
unspecified order) and then applies the value of the first one,
which had better be a procedure, to the values of the rest of them.
Those other subexpressions are the arguments.
 
<P>We can use this rule to evaluate arbitrarily complex expressions, and
Scheme won't get confused.  No matter how long the expression is, it's made
up of smaller subexpressions to which the same rule applies.
Look at this long, messy example:
<A NAME="g9"></A> 
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (+ (* 2 (/ 14 7) 3)
     (/ (* (- (* 3 5) 3) (+ 1 1))
        (- (* 4 3) (* 3 2)))
     (- 15 18))
13
</PRE> 
 
<P>Scheme understands this by looking for the subexpressions of the overall
expression, like this:
 
<P><PRE>(+ ()
   (        ; One of them takes two lines but you can tell by
      )     ; matching parentheses that they're one expression.
   ())
</PRE> 
 
<P>(Scheme ignores everything to the right of a semicolon, so
semicolons can be used to indicate comments, as above.)
 
<P> 
Notice that in the example above we asked <CODE>+</CODE> to add <EM>three</EM> 
numbers.  In the <CODE>functions</CODE> program of Chapter 2 we
pretended that every Scheme function accepts a fixed number of arguments,
but actually, some functions can accept any number.  These include <CODE>+</CODE>,
<CODE>*</CODE>, <CODE>word</CODE>, and <CODE>sentence</CODE>.
