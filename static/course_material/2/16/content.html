<P>As we mentioned in Chapter 3, everything that you type into Scheme is
evaluated and the resulting value is printed out.  Let's say you want to use
&quot;square&quot; as a word in your program.  For example, you want your program to
solve the problem, &quot;Give me an adjective that describes
<A NAME="g1"></A>Barry Manilow.&quot; If you just type <CODE>square</CODE> into Scheme, you
will find out that <CODE>square</CODE> is a procedure:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; square
#&lt;PROCEDURE>
</PRE> 
 
<P>(Different versions of Scheme will have different ways of printing
out procedures.)
 
<P>What you need is a way to say that you want to use the word &quot;<CODE>square</CODE>&quot;
<EM>itself,</EM> rather than the <EM>value</EM> of that word, as an
expression.  The way to do this is to use <A NAME="g2"></A><CODE>quote</CODE>:
<A NAME="spquote"></A> 
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (quote square)
SQUARE
 
&gt; (quote (tomorrow never knows))
(TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS)
 
&gt; (quote (things we said today))
(THINGS WE SAID TODAY)
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>Quote</CODE> is a <A NAME="g3"></A><A NAME="g4"></A>special form, since its argument isn't evaluated.
Instead, it just returns the argument as is.
 
<P>Scheme programmers use <CODE>quote</CODE> a lot, so there is an abbreviation for it:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; 'square
SQUARE
 
&gt; '(old brown shoe)
(old brown shoe)
</PRE> 
 
<P>(Since Scheme uses the apostrophe as an abbreviation for <CODE><A NAME="g5"></A> 
quote</CODE>, you can't use one as an ordinary punctuation mark in a sentence.
That's why we've been avoiding titles like <CODE>(can't buy me love)</CODE>.
To Scheme this would mean <CODE>(can (quote t) buy me love)</CODE>!)

<P><small><small>Actually, it <em>is</em> possible to put punctuation inside
words as long as the entire word is enclosed in double-quote marks, like this:

<P><pre>&gt; '("can't" buy me love)
("can't" BUY ME LOVE)</pre>

<p>Words like that are called <em>strings</em>.  We're not going to use them
in any examples until almost the end of the book.  Stay away from punctuation
and you won't get in trouble.  However, question marks and exclamation points
are okay.  (Ordinary words, the ones that are neither strings nor numbers,
are officially called <em>symbols</em>.</small></small>

<P>This idea of quoting, although it may seem arbitrary in the context of
computer programming, is actually quite familiar from ordinary English.
What is a book?  It's a bunch of pieces of paper, with printing on them,
bound together.  What is &quot;a book&quot;?  It's a noun phrase, made up of an article
and a noun.  See?  Similarly, what's 2+3?  It's five.  What's &quot;2+3&quot;?
It's an arithmetic formula.  When you see words inside quotation marks, you
understand that you're supposed to think about the words themselves; you
don't evaluate what they mean.  Scheme is the same way.
 
<P>(It's no accident that kids who make jokes like
 
<P><P><BLOCKQUOTE>Matt:  &quot;Say your name.&quot;
 
<P>Brian:  &quot;Your name.&quot;
 
<P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P><P>grow up to be computer programmers.  The difference between a
thing and its name is one of the important ideas that programmers need to
understand.)
