<P>We've been avoiding apostrophes in our words and sentences because
they're abbreviations for the <CODE>quote</CODE> special form.  You must also avoid
periods, commas, semicolons, quotation marks, vertical bars, and, of course,
parentheses, since all of these have special meanings in Scheme.  You may,
however, use question marks and exclamation points.
 
<P>Although we've already mentioned the need to avoid names of primitives
when choosing formal parameters, we want to remind you specifically about the
names <CODE>word</CODE> and <CODE>sentence</CODE>.  These are often very tempting formal
parameters, because many procedures have words or sentences as their
domains.  Unfortunately, if you choose these names for parameters, you won't
be able to use the corresponding procedures within your definition.
 
<P><PRE>(define (plural word)                        ;; wrong!
  (word word 's))
 
&gt; (plural 'george)
ERROR: GEORGE isn't a procedure
</PRE> 
 
<P>The result of substitution was not, as you might think,
 
<P><PRE>(word 'george 's)
</PRE> 
 
<P>but rather
 
<P><PRE>('george 'george 's)
</PRE> 
 
<P>We've been using <CODE>wd</CODE> and <CODE>sent</CODE> as formal parameters
instead of <CODE>word</CODE> and <CODE>sentence</CODE>, and we recommend that practice.
 
<P>There's a difference between a word and a single-word sentence.  For
example, people often fall into the trap of thinking that the <CODE>butfirst</CODE> 
of a two-word sentence such as <CODE>(sexy sadie)</CODE> is the second word, but it's
not.  It's a one-word-long sentence.  For example, its <CODE>count</CODE> is one, not five.
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (bf '(sexy sadie))
(SADIE)
 
&gt; (first (bf '(sexy sadie)))
SADIE
</PRE> 
 
<P>We mentioned earlier that sometimes Scheme has to put double-quote marks
around words.  Just ignore them; don't get upset if your procedure returns
<CODE>&quot;6-of-hearts&quot;</CODE> instead of just <CODE>6-of-hearts</CODE>.
 
<P><CODE>Quote</CODE> doesn't mean &quot;print.&quot; Some people look at interactions
like this:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; '(good night)
(GOOD NIGHT)
</PRE> 
 
<P>and think that the quotation mark was an instruction telling
Scheme to print what comes after it.  Actually, Scheme <EM>always</EM> prints
the value of each expression you type, as part of the read-eval-print loop.
In this case, the value of the entire expression is the subexpression that's
being quoted, namely, the sentence <CODE>(good night)</CODE>.  That value wouldn't
be printed if the quotation were part of some larger expression:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (bf '(good night))
(NIGHT)
</PRE> 
 
<P>If you see an error message like
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (+ 3 (bf 1075))
ERROR: INVALID ARGUMENT TO +: &quot;075"
</PRE> 
 
<P>try entering the expression
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (strings-are-numbers #t)
OKAY
</PRE> 
 
<P>and try again.  (The extension to Scheme that allows arithmetic
operations to work on nonstandard numbers like <CODE>&quot;075&quot;</CODE> makes ordinary
arithmetic slower than usual.  So we've provided a way to turn the extension
on and off.  Invoking <CODE>strings-are-numbers</CODE> with the argument <CODE>#f</CODE> turns off the extension.)
