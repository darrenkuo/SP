<P>So far all we've done with words and sentences is quote them.  To do more
interesting work, we need tools for two kinds of operations:  We have to be
able to take them apart, and we have to be able to put them
together. We'll start with the take-apart tools; the technical term for them is <EM>selectors.</EM> 
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (first 'something)
S
 
&gt; (first '(eight days a week))
EIGHT
 
&gt; (first 910)
9
 
&gt; (last 'something)
G
 
&gt; (last '(eight days a week))
WEEK
 
&gt; (last 910)
0
 
&gt; (butfirst 'something)
OMETHING
 
&gt; (butfirst '(eight days a week))
(DAYS A WEEK)
 
&gt; (butfirst 910)
10
 
&gt; (butlast 'something)
SOMETHIN
 
&gt; (butlast '(eight days a week))
(EIGHT DAYS A)
 
&gt; (butlast 910)
91
</PRE> 
 
<P>Notice that the <A NAME="g9"></A><CODE>first</CODE> of a sentence is a word, while the
<CODE>first</CODE> of a word is a letter.  (But there's no separate data type
called &quot;letter&quot;; a letter is the same as a one-letter word.)  The
<A NAME="g10"></A><CODE>butfirst</CODE> of a sentence is a sentence, and the <CODE>butfirst</CODE> of a
word is a word.  The corresponding rules hold for <A NAME="g11"></A><CODE>last</CODE> and
<A NAME="g12"></A><CODE>butlast</CODE>.
 
<P>The names <CODE>butfirst</CODE> and <CODE>butlast</CODE> aren't meant to describe ways to
sled; they abbreviate &quot;all <CODE>but</CODE> the <CODE>first</CODE>&quot; and &quot;all <CODE>but</CODE> 
the <CODE>last</CODE>.&quot;
 
<P>You may be wondering why we're given ways to find the first and last
elements but not the 42nd element.  It turns out that the ones we have are
enough, since we can use these primitive selectors to define others:
 
<P> 
<PRE>(define (<A NAME="g13"></A>second thing)
  (first (butfirst thing)))
 
&gt; (second '(like dreamers do))
DREAMERS
 
&gt; (second 'michelle)
I
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
 
<P>There is, however, a primitive selector <CODE>item</CODE> that takes
two arguments, a number <EM>n</EM> and a word or sentence, and returns the <EM>n</EM>th
element of the second argument.
 
<P> 
<PRE>&gt; (item 4 '(being for the benefit of mister kite!))
BENEFIT
 
&gt; (item 4 'benefit)
E
</PRE> 
 
 
<P>Don't forget that a sentence containing exactly one word is different from
the word itself, and selectors operate on the two differently:
 
<P> 
<PRE>&gt; (first 'because)
B
 
&gt; (first '(because))
BECAUSE
</PRE> 
 
<P> 
<PRE>&gt; (butfirst 'because)
ECAUSE
 
<A NAME="g14"></A><A NAME="g15"></A>&gt; (butfirst '(because))
()
</PRE> 
 
<P>The value of that last expression is the <EM>empty sentence.</EM>  You can tell it's a sentence because of the
parentheses, and you can tell it's empty because there's nothing between
them.
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (butfirst 'a)
&quot;"
 
&gt; (butfirst 1024)
&quot;024"
</PRE> 
 
<P>As these examples show, sometimes <CODE>butfirst</CODE> returns a word
that has to have double-quote marks around it.  The first example
shows the <EM><A NAME="g16"></A>empty word,</EM> while the second shows a number
that's not in its ordinary form.  (Its numeric value is 24, but you don't
usually see a zero in front.)
 
<P><PRE>&gt; 024
24
 
&gt; &quot;024"
&quot;024"
</PRE> 
 
<P>We're going to try to avoid printing these funny words.  But don't
be surprised if you see one as the return value from one of the selectors
for words.  (Notice that you don't have to put a single quote in front of
the double quotes.  Strings are self-evaluating, just as numbers are.)
<A NAME="g17"></A> 
<A NAME="g18"></A> 
<A NAME="g19"></A> 
 
<P>Since <CODE>butfirst</CODE> and <CODE>butlast</CODE> are so hard to type, there are
abbreviations <A NAME="g20"></A><CODE>bf</CODE> and <A NAME="g21"></A><CODE>bl</CODE>.  You can figure out which is which.
