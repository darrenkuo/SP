<P>Functions for putting things together are called <EM>constructors.</EM> 
For now, we just have two of them: <A NAME="g22"></A><CODE>word</CODE> and <A NAME="g23"></A><CODE>sentence</CODE>.  <CODE>Word</CODE> takes any number of words as arguments and joins them all together
into one humongous word:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (word 'ses 'qui 'pe 'da 'lian 'ism)
SESQUIPEDALIANISM
 
&gt; (word 'now 'here)
NOWHERE
 
&gt; (word 35 893)
35893
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>Sentence</CODE> is similar, but slightly different, since it can take both 
words and sentences as arguments:
 
<P><PRE>&gt;  (sentence 'carry 'that 'weight)
(CARRY THAT WEIGHT)
 
&gt; (sentence '(john paul) '(george ringo))
(JOHN PAUL GEORGE RINGO)
</PRE> 
 
<P><CODE>Sentence</CODE> is also too hard to type, so there's the
abbreviation <A NAME="g24"></A><CODE>se</CODE>.
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (se '(one plus one) 'makes 2)
(ONE PLUS ONE MAKES 2)
</PRE> 
 
<P>By the way, why did we have to quote <CODE>makes</CODE> in the last example, but
not <CODE>2</CODE>?  It's because numbers are self-evaluating, as we said
<A NAME="g25"></A> 
<A NAME="g26"></A> 
in Chapter 3.  We have to quote <CODE>makes</CODE> because otherwise Scheme
would look for something named <CODE>makes</CODE> instead of using the word
itself.  But numbers can't be the names of things; they represent
themselves.  (In fact, you could quote the <CODE>2</CODE> and it wouldn't make any difference&mdash;do you see why?)
