<P>What's the average of 17 and 25?  To answer this question you could add the
two numbers, getting 42, and divide that by two, getting 21.  You could ask
Scheme to do this for you:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (/ (+ 17 25) 2)
21
</PRE> 
 
<P>What's the average of 14 and 68?
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (/ (+ 14 68) 2)
41
</PRE> 
 
<P>Once you understand the technique, you could answer any such question by
typing an expression of the form
 
<P><PRE>(/ (+  ______  ______ ) 2)
</PRE> 
 
<P>to Scheme.
 
<P>But if you're going to be faced with more such problems, an obvious next
step is to <EM>generalize</EM> the technique by defining a procedure:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g17"></A>average a b)
  (/ (+ a b) 2))
</PRE> 
 
<P>With this definition, you can think about the next problem that
comes along in terms of the problem itself, rather than in terms of the
steps required for its solution:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (average 27 4)
15.5
</PRE> 
 
<P>This is an example of what we meant when we defined
&quot;abstraction&quot; as noticing a pattern and giving it a name.
It's not so different from the naming of such patterns in English;
when someone invented the name &quot;average&quot; it was, probably, after
noticing that it was often useful to find the value halfway between
two other values.
 
<P>This naming process is more important than it sounds, because once we have a
name for some idea, we can use that idea without thinking about its pieces.
For example, suppose that you want to know not only the average of some
numbers but also a measure of whether the numbers are clumped together close
to the average, or widely spread out.  Statisticians have developed the
&quot;standard deviation&quot; as a measure of this second property.  You'd rather
not have to think about this mysterious formula:
 
<P><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="###content_dir###/math1.gif" ALT="math display"></CENTER><P> 
 
<P>but you'd be happy to use a procedure <CODE>standard-deviation</CODE> 
that you found in a collection of statistical programs.
 
<P>After all, there's no law of nature that says computers automatically know
how to add or subtract.  You could imagine having to instruct Scheme to
compute the sum of two large numbers digit by digit, the way you did in
elementary school.  But instead someone has &quot;taught&quot; your computer how to
add before you get to it, giving this technique the name <CODE>+</CODE> so that you
can ask for the sum of two numbers without thinking about the steps required.
By inventing <CODE>average</CODE> or <CODE>standard-deviation</CODE> we are extending the
repertoire of computations that you can ask for without concerning yourself
with the details.
