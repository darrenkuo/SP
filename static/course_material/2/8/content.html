<P>A Scheme program consists of one or more <EM>procedures.</EM> A procedure is
a description of the process by which a computer can work out some result
that we want.  Here's how to define a procedure that returns the square of
its argument:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g1"></A>square x)
  (* x x))
</PRE> 
 
<P>(The value returned by <A NAME="g2"></A><CODE>define</CODE> may differ depending on the
version of Scheme you're using.  Many versions return the name of the
procedure you're defining, but others return something else.  It doesn't
matter, because when you use <CODE>define</CODE> you aren't interested in the
returned value, but rather in the fact that Scheme remembers the new
definition for later use.)
 
<P>This is the definition of a procedure called <CODE>square</CODE>.  <CODE>Square</CODE> 
takes one argument, a number, and it returns the square of that number.
Once you have defined <CODE>square</CODE>, you can use it just the same way as you
use primitive procedures:
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (square 7)
49
 
&gt; (+ 10 (square 2))
14
 
&gt; (square (square 3))
81
</PRE> 
 
<P>This procedure definition has four parts.  The first is the word <CODE>define</CODE>, which indicates that you are defining something.  The second and
third come together inside parentheses: the name that you want to give the
procedure and the name(s) you want to use for its argument(s).  This
arrangement was chosen by the designers of Scheme because it looks like the
form in which the procedure will be invoked.  That is, <CODE>(square x)</CODE> looks
like <CODE>(square 7)</CODE>.  The fourth part of the definition is the <EM>body:</EM> an expression whose value provides the function's return value.
