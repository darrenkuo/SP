<P>We've paid a lot of attention to the details of formal parameters and actual
arguments, but we've been a little handwavy about how a procedure actually computes a value when you invoke it.
 
<P>We're going to explain what happens when you invoke a user-defined procedure.
Every explanation is a story.  No story tells the entire truth, because there
are always some details left out.  A <EM>model</EM> is a story that
has just enough detail to help you understand whatever it's trying to explain
but not so much detail that you can't see the forest for the trees.
 
<P>Today's story is about the <EM>substitution</EM> model.  When a
procedure is invoked, the goal is to carry out the computation described in
its body.  The problem is that the body is written in terms of the formal
parameters, while the computation has to use the actual argument values.  So
what Scheme needs is a way to associate actual argument values with formal
parameters.  It does this by making a new copy of the body of the procedure,
in which it substitutes the argument values for every appearance of the
formal parameters, and then evaluating the resulting expression.  So, if
you've defined <CODE>square</CODE> with 
 
<P><PRE>(define (square x)
  (* x x))
</PRE> 
 
<P>then the body of <CODE>square</CODE> is <CODE>(* x x)</CODE>.  When you want to
know the square of a particular number, as in <CODE>(square 5)</CODE>, Scheme
substitutes the 5 for <CODE>x</CODE> everywhere in the body of square and evaluates
the expression.  In other words, Scheme takes
 
<P><PRE>(* x x)
</PRE> 
 
<P>then does the substitution, getting
 
<P><PRE>(* 5 5)
</PRE> 
 
<P>and then evaluates that expression, getting 25.
 
<P>If you just type <CODE>(* x x)</CODE> into Scheme, you will get an error message
complaining that <CODE>x</CODE> doesn't mean anything.  Only after the substitution
does this become a meaningful expression.
 
<P>By the way, when we talk about &quot;substituting into the body,&quot; we don't mean
that the procedure's definition is changed in any permanent way.  The body of
the procedure doesn't change; what happens, as we said before, is that Scheme
constructs a new expression that looks like the body, except for the
substitutions.
 
<P>There are little people who specialize in <CODE>square</CODE>, just as there
are little people who specialize in <CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>*</CODE>.  The difference is
that the little people who do primitive procedures can do the work &quot;in their
head,&quot; all at once.  The little people who carry out user-defined procedures
have to go through this substitution business we're talking about here.
Then they hire other little people to help evaluate the resulting expression,
just as Alonzo hires people to help him evaluate the expressions you type
directly to Scheme.
 
<P>Let's say Sam, a little person who specializes in <CODE>square</CODE>, has been
asked to compute <CODE>(square 6)</CODE>.  Sam carries out the substitution, and is
left with the expression <CODE>(* 6 6)</CODE> to evaluate.  Sam then hires Tessa, a
multiplication specialist, to evaluate this new expression.  Tessa tells Sam
that her answer is 36, and, because the multiplication is the entire problem
to be solved, this is Sam's answer also.
 
<P>Here's another example:
 
<P><PRE>(define (<A NAME="g20"></A>hypotenuse a b)
  (sqrt (+ (square a) (square b))))
 
&gt; (hypotenuse 5 12)
</PRE> 
 
<P> Suppose Alonzo hires Harry to compute this expression.
Harry must first substitute the actual argument values (5 and 12) into the
body of <CODE>hypotenuse</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(sqrt (+ (square 5) (square 12)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Now he evaluates that expression, just as Alonzo would evaluate it
if you typed it at a Scheme prompt.  That is, Harry hires four little
people: one <CODE>sqrt</CODE> expert, one <CODE>+</CODE> expert, and two <CODE>square</CODE> 
experts. In particular, some little
person has to evaluate <CODE>(square 5)</CODE>, by substituting 5 for <CODE>x</CODE> in
the body of <CODE>square</CODE>, as in the earlier example.  Similarly, we
substitute 12 for <CODE>x</CODE> in order to evaluate <CODE>(square 12)</CODE>:
 
<P><PRE>(hypotenuse 5 12)                   ; substitute into HYPOTENUSE body
(sqrt (+ (square 5) (square 12)))   ; substitute for (SQUARE 5)
         (* 5 5)
         25
(sqrt (+ 25         (square 12)))   ; substitute for (SQUARE 12)
                    (* 12 12)
                    144
(sqrt (+ 25         144))
      (+ 25         144)            ; combine the results as before
      169
(sqrt 169)
13
</PRE> 
 
<P>Don't forget, in the heady rush of learning about the substitution
model, what you already knew from before:  Each piece of this computation is
done by a little person, and some other little person is waiting for the
result.  In other words, the substitution model tells us how <EM>each
compound procedure</EM> is carried out, but doesn't change our picture of the
way in which procedure invocations are <EM>composed</EM> into larger
expressions.
