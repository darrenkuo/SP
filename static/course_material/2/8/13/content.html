 
<P>We've suggested that a procedure you define, such as <CODE>average</CODE>, is
<A NAME="g18"></A> 
<A NAME="g19"></A> 
essentially similar to one that's built into Scheme, such as <CODE>+</CODE>.
In particular, the rules for building expressions are the same whether
the building blocks are primitive procedures or defined procedures.
 
<P><PRE>&gt; (average (+ 10 8) (* 3 5))
16.5
 
&gt; (average (average 2 3) (average 4 5))
3.5
 
&gt; (sqrt (average 143 145))
12
</PRE> 
 
<P>Any return value can be used as an end in itself, as the return
value from <CODE>sqrt</CODE> was used in the last of these examples, or it can
provide an argument to another procedure, as the return value from
<CODE>*</CODE> was used in the first of these examples.
 
<P>These small examples may seem arbitrary, but the same idea, composition of
functions, is the basis for all Scheme programming.  For example, the
complicated formula we gave for standard deviation requires computing the
squares of several numbers.  So if we were to write a <CODE>standard-deviation</CODE> procedure, it would invoke <CODE>square</CODE>.
