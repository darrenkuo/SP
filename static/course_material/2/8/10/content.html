<P>Throughout most of this book, our procedures will describe processes that
<A NAME="g5"></A> 
<A NAME="g6"></A> 
compute <EM>functions.</EM> A function is a connection between some values
you already know and a new value you want to find out.  For example, the
<EM>square</EM> function takes a number, such as 8, as its input value and
returns another number, 64 in this case, as its output value.  The <EM>plural</EM> function takes a noun, such as &quot;computer,&quot; and returns another
word, &quot;computers&quot; in this example.  The technical term for the function's
input value is its <EM>argument.</EM> A function may take more than one
argument; for example, the <CODE>remainder</CODE> function takes two arguments,
such as 12 and 5.  It returns one value, the remainder on dividing the first
argument by the second (in this case, 2).
 
<P>We said earlier that a procedure is &quot;a description of the process by which
a computer can work out some result that we want.&quot; What do we mean by <EM>process</EM>?  Consider these two definitions:
 
<P><P><P><CENTER><EM>f</EM>(<EM>x</EM>)=3<EM>x</EM>+12<BR> 
<EM>g</EM>(<EM>x</EM>)=3(<EM>x</EM>+4)<P></CENTER> 
 
The two definitions call for different arithmetic operations.  For
example, to compute <EM>f</EM>(8) we'd multiply 8 by 3, then add 12 to the result.
To compute <EM>g</EM>(8), we'd add 4 to 8, then multiply the result by 3.  But we
get the same answer, 36, either way.  These two equations describe different
<EM>processes,</EM> but they compute the same <EM>function.</EM> The function
is just the association between the starting value(s) and the resulting
value, no matter how that result is computed.  In Scheme we could say
 
<P><PRE>(define (f x)
  (+ (* 3 x) 12))
 
(define (g x)
  (* 3 (+ x 4)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>and we'd say that <CODE>f</CODE> and <CODE>g</CODE> are two procedures that
represent the same function.
 
<P>In real life, functions are not always represented by procedures.  We could
represent a function by a <EM>table</EM> showing all its possible values,
like this:
 
<P><P><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD>Alabama<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Montgomery
<TR><TD>Alaska<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juneau
<TR><TD>Arizona<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phoenix
<TR><TD>Arkansas<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Rock
<TR><TD>California<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacramento
<TR><TD>&hellip;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip;</TABLE></CENTER> 
 
This table represents the State Capital function; we haven't shown
all the lines of the complete table, but we could.  There are only a finite
number of U.S. states.  Numeric functions can also be represented by <EM>graphs,</EM> as you probably learned in high school algebra.  In this book our
focus is on the representation of functions by procedures.  The only reason
for showing you this table example is to clarify what we mean when we say
that a function <EM>is represented by</EM> a procedure, rather than that a
function <EM>is</EM> the procedure.
 
<P>We'll say &quot;the procedure <CODE>f</CODE>&quot; when we want to discuss the operations
we're telling Scheme to carry out.  We'll say &quot;the function represented by
<CODE>f</CODE>&quot; when our attention is focused on the value returned, rather than
on the mechanism.  (But we'll often abbreviate that lengthy second phrase
with &quot;the function <CODE>f</CODE>&quot; unless the context is especially
confusing.)
