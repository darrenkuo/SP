<P>&quot;It's long,&quot; said the Knight, &quot;but it's very, <EM>very</EM> beautiful.
Everybody that hears me sing it&mdash;either it brings the <EM>tears</EM> into
their eyes, or else&mdash;&quot;
 
<P>&quot;Or else what?&quot; said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.
 
<P>&ldquo;Or else it doesn't, you know.  The name of the song is called &lsquo;<EM>Haddock's Eyes.</EM>&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo;
 
<P>&quot;Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?&quot; Alice said, trying to feel
interested.
 
<P>&quot;No, you don't understand,&quot; the Knight said, looking a little vexed.
&ldquo;That's what the name is <EM>called.</EM> The name really is &lsquo;<EM>The Aged
Aged Man.</EM>&rsquo&thinsp;&rdquo;
 
<P>&ldquo;Then I ought to have said &lsquo;That's what the <EM>song</EM> is called&rsquo;?&rdquo; 
Alice corrected herself.
 
<P>&ldquo;No, you oughtn't; that's quite another thing!  The <EM>song</EM> is called
&lsquo<EM>Ways And Means</EM>&rsquo: but that's only what it's <EM>called,</EM> you
know!&rdquo;
 
<P>&quot;Well, what <EM>is</EM> the song, then?&quot; said Alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered.
 
<P>&quot;I was coming to that,&quot; the Knight said.  &ldquo;The song really is &lsquo<EM>A-sitting On A Gate</EM>&rsquo;: and the tune's my own invention.&rdquo;

Notice that when we <EM>defined</EM> the <CODE>square</CODE> procedure we gave a <EM>name,</EM> <CODE>x</CODE>, for its argument.  By contrast, when we <EM>invoked</EM> 
<CODE>square</CODE> we provided a <EM>value</EM> for the argument (e.g., <CODE>7</CODE>).
The word <CODE>x</CODE> is a &quot;place holder&quot; in the definition that stands for
whatever value you use when you call the procedure.  So you can read the
definition of <CODE>square</CODE> as saying, &quot;In order to <CODE>square</CODE> a number,
multiply <EM>that number</EM> by <EM>that number.</EM>&quot; The name <CODE>x</CODE> 
holds the place of the particular number that you mean.
 
<P>Be sure you understand this distinction between defining a procedure and
calling it.  A procedure represents a general technique that can be applied
to many specific cases.  We don't want to build any particular case into the
procedure definition; we want the definition to express the general nature of
the technique.  You wouldn't want a procedure that only knew how to take the
square of 7.  But when you actually get around to using <CODE>square</CODE>, you have
to be specific about which number you're squaring.
 
<P>The name for the name of an argument (whew!) is <EM><A NAME="g8"></A><A NAME="g9"></A>formal parameter.</EM> In our <CODE>square</CODE> example, <CODE>x</CODE> 
is the formal parameter.  (You may hear people say either &quot;formal&quot;
alone or &quot;parameter&quot; alone when they're feeling lazy.)  The
technical term for the actual value of the argument is the <EM><A NAME="g10"></A><A NAME="g11"></A>actual argument.</EM> In a case like
 
<P> 
<PRE>(square (+ 5 9))
</PRE> 
 
 
<P> 
you may want to distinguish the <EM><A NAME="g12"></A><A NAME="g13"></A>actual argument expression</EM> <CODE>(+ 5 9)</CODE> from the <EM><A NAME="g14"></A><A NAME="g15"></A>actual argument value</EM> 14.  Most of the time it's perfectly clear
what you mean, and you just say &quot;argument&quot; for all of these things, but
right now when you're learning these ideas it's important to be able to talk
more precisely.
 
<P> 
The <CODE>square</CODE> procedure takes one argument.  If a procedure requires more
than one argument, then the question arises, which actual argument goes with
which formal parameter?  The answer is that they go in the order in which
you write them, like this:
 
<P><PRE>(define (f a b)
  (+ (* 3 a) b))
 
&gt; (f 5 8)
23
 
&gt; (f 8 5)
29
