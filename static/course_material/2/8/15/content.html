<P>Don't forget that a function can have only <EM>one</EM> return value.
For example, here's a program that's supposed to return the sum of the
squares of its two arguments:
 
<P><PRE>(define (sum-of-squares x y)                 ;; wrong!
  (square x)
  (square y))
</PRE> 
 
<P>The problem is that the body of this procedure has two expressions,
instead of just one.  As it turns out, Scheme just ignores the value of the
first expression in cases like this, and returns the value of the last one.
What the programmer wants is the <EM>sum</EM> of these two values, so the
procedure should say
 
<P><PRE>(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x)
     (square y)))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Another pitfall comes from thinking that a procedure call changes the
value of a parameter.  Here's a faulty program that's supposed to compute
the function described by <EM>f</EM>(<EM>x</EM>)=3<EM>x</EM>+10:
 
<P><PRE>(define (f x)                                ;; wrong!
  (* x 3)
  (+ x 10))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Again, the first expression has no effect and Scheme will just
return the value <EM>x</EM>+10.
 
<P>A very common pitfall in Scheme comes from choosing the name of
a procedure as a parameter.  It doesn't come up very often with
procedures like the ones in this chapter whose domains and ranges
are both numbers, but it will be more likely later.  If you have a
program like this:
 
<P><PRE>(define (square x)
  (* x x))
 
(define (area square)                        ;; wrong!
  (square square))
</PRE> 
 
<P>then you'll get in trouble when you invoke the procedure, for
example, by saying <CODE>(area 8)</CODE>.  The <CODE>area</CODE> little person will
substitute <CODE>8</CODE> for <CODE>square</CODE> everywhere in the procedure definition,
leaving you with the expression <CODE>(8 8)</CODE> to evaluate.  That expression
would mean to apply the procedure <CODE>8</CODE> to the argument <CODE>8</CODE>, but
<CODE>8</CODE> isn't a procedure, so an error message results.
 
<P>It isn't a problem if the formal parameter is the name of a procedure that
you don't use inside the body.  The problem arises when you try to use the
same name, e.g., <CODE>square</CODE>, with two meanings within a single procedure.
But special forms are an exception; you can never use the name of a special
form as a parameter.
 
<P>A similar problem about name conflicts comes up if you try to
use a keyword (the name of a special form, such as <CODE>define</CODE>) as
some other kind of name&mdash;either a formal parameter or the name of a
procedure you're defining.  We're listing this separately because the
result is likely to be different.  Instead of getting the wrong value
substituted, as above, you'll probably see a special error message
along the lines of &quot;improper use of keyword.&quot;
 
<P>Formal parameters <EM>must</EM> be words.  Some people try to write
procedures that have compound expressions as the formal parameters, like this:
 
<P><PRE>(define (f (+ 3 x) y)                        ;; wrong!
  (* x y))
</PRE> 
 
<P>Remember that the job of the procedure definition is only to
provide a <EM>name</EM> for the argument.  The <EM>actual</EM> argument isn't
pinned down until you invoke the procedure.  People who write programs like
the one above are trying to make the procedure definition do some of the job
of the procedure invocation.
