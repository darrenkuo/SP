<a name="%_idx_4670"></a><a name="%_idx_4672"></a>Now that we have an evaluator expressed as a Lisp program, we can
experiment with alternative choices in language design simply by
modifying the evaluator.  Indeed, new languages are often invented by
first writing an evaluator that embeds the new language within an
existing high-level language.  For example, if we wish to discuss some
aspect of a proposed modification to Lisp with another member of the
Lisp community, we can supply an evaluator that embodies
the change.  The recipient can then experiment with the new
evaluator and send back comments as further modifications.  Not only
does the high-level implementation base make it easier to test and
debug the evaluator; in addition, the embedding enables the designer
to snarf features
from the underlying language, just as our embedded Lisp evaluator
uses primitives and control structure from the underlying Lisp.  Only
later (if ever) need the designer go to the trouble of building a
complete implementation in a low-level language or in hardware.  In
this section and the next we explore some variations on Scheme that
provide significant additional expressive power.<p>
