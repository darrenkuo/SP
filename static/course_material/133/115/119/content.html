<b>CS 61A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Week 14</b>
<p>
Topic: lazy evaluator, nondeterministic evaluator
<p>
<b>Reading:</b>
Abelson &amp; Sussman, Section 4.2, 4.3
<p>
A version of the lazy evaluator is online in
<tt>&#126;cs61a/lib/lazy.scm</tt>

<p>
A version of the nondeterministic evaluator is online in
<tt>&#126;cs61a/lib/ambeval.scm</tt>

<p>
A modified version of the nondeterministic evaluator, based
on the vanilla metacircular evaluator rather than on the
analyzing evaluator, is online in
<tt>&#126;cs61a/lib/vambeval.scm</tt>

<b>Homework:</b>
<p>
There are a lot of exercises this week, because we are covering a lot of
material.  These are all great exercises, from which you'll learn a lot,
but for those who find the homework time-consuming, we're dividing them
into two categories, crucial and less-crucial.  Again, I recommend all
of them!

<p>
crucial:  4.25, 4.26, 4.28, 4.42, 4.45, 4.49, 4.50, 4.52

<p>
less crucial:  4.30, 4.32, 4.33, 4.36, 4.47, 4.48

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Part II of the fourth programming project is also due next week.

<p>
<b>Extra for experts:</b>
<p>
Exercise 4.31 in Abelson and Sussman.  This exercise doesn't require
great brilliance, but it's a lot of work and involves a lot of debugging
of details.  On the other hand, completing this exercise will teach you
a lot about the evaluator.

<p>
Fix the <tt>handle-infix</tt> procedure from project 4
to handle infix precedence for arithmetic operators properly.
That is, multiplications and divisions should be done before
additions and subtractions.  Comparison operators like 
come last of all.
