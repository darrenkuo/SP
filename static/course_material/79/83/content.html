The purpose of the environment model is to represent the scope of
variables; when you see an <tt>x</tt> in a program, which variable <tt>x</tt>
does it mean?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another way to solve this problem would be to <i>rename </i> all the
local variables so that there are never two variables with the same name.
Write a procedure <tt>unique-rename</tt> that takes a (quoted) lambda expression
as its argument, and returns an equivalent lambda expression with the
variables renamed to be unique:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (unique-rename '(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (x (lambda (x) (y x))))))
(lambda (g1) (lambda (g2) (g1 (lambda (g3) (g2 g3)))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that the original expression had two variables named <tt>x</tt>, and
in the returned expression it's clear from the names which is which.
You'll need a modified counter object to generate the unique names.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You may assume that there are no <tt>quote</tt>, <tt>let</tt>, or <tt>define</tt>
expressions, so that every symbol is a variable reference, and variables are
created only by <tt>lambda</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Describe how you'd use <tt>unique-rename</tt> to allow the evaluation of
Scheme programs with only a single (global) frame.
