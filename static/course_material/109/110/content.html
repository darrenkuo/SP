in order to get the analyzing metacircular evaluator.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Inefficiency in the Metacircular Evaluator</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Suppose we've defined the factorial function as follows:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (fact num)
  (if (= num 0)
      1
      (* num (fact (- num 1)))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What happens when we compute <tt>(fact&nbsp;3)</tt>?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>eval (fact 3)
  self-evaluating?  ==&#62;  #f     if-alternative  ==&#62;  (* num (fact (- num 1)))
  variable?  ==&#62;  #f               eval (* num (fact (- num 1)))
  quoted?  ==&#62;  #f                   self-evaluating?  ==&#62;  #f
  assignment?  ==&#62;  #f               ...
  definition?  ==&#62;  #f               list-of-values (num (fact (- num 1)))
  if?  ==&#62;  #f                         ...
  lambda?  ==&#62;  #f                     eval (fact (- num 1))
  begin?  ==&#62;  #f                        ...
  cond?  ==&#62;  #f                         apply &lt;procedure fact&#62; (2)
  application?  ==&#62;  #t                    eval (if (= num 0) ...)
  eval fact
    self-evaluating?  ==&#62;  #f
    variable?  ==&#62;  #t
    lookup-variable-value  ==&#62;  &lt;procedure fact&#62;
    list-of-values (3)
      eval 3  ==&#62; 3
    apply &lt;procedure fact&#62; (3)
      eval (if (= num 0) ...)
	self-evaluating?  ==&#62;  #f
	variable?  ==&#62;  #f
	quoted?  ==&#62;  #f
	assignment?  ==&#62;  #f
	definition?  ==&#62;  #f
        if?  ==&#62;  #t
          eval-if (if (= num 0) ...)
            if-predicate  ==&#62;  (= num 0)
              eval (= num 0)
                self-evaluating?  ==&#62;  #f
                ...

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Four separate times, the evaluator has to examine the procedure body,
decide that it's an <tt>if</tt> expression, pull out its component parts,
and evaluate those parts (which in turn involves deciding what type
of expression each part is).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is one reason why interpreted languages are so much slower than compiled
languages:  The interpreter does the syntactic analysis of the program over
and over again.  The compiler does the analysis once, and the compiled
program can just do the part of the computation that depends on the actual
values of variables.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Separating Analysis from Execution</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>Eval</tt> takes two arguments, an expression and an environment.  Of those,
the expression argument is (obviously!)&nbsp;the same every time we revisit the
same expression, whereas the environment will be different each time.  For
example, when we compute <tt>(fact&nbsp;3)</tt> we evaluate the body of <tt>fact</tt>
in an environment in which <tt>num</tt> has the value 3.  That body includes
a recursive call to compute <tt>(fact&nbsp;2)</tt>, in which we evaluate the same
body, but now in an environment with <tt>num</tt> bound to 2.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Our plan is to look at the evaluation process, find those parts which depend
only on <tt>exp</tt> and not on <tt>env</tt>, and do those only once.  The
procedure that does this work is called <tt>analyze</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What is the result of <tt>analyze</tt>?  It has to be something that can
be combined somehow with an environment in order to return a value.
The solution is that <tt>analyze</tt> returns a procedure that takes only
<tt>env</tt> as an argument, and does the rest of the evaluation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Instead of

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(eval exp env)  ==&#62;  value

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
we now have

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>1.  (analyze exp)  ==&#62;  exp-procedure
2.  (exp-procedure env)  ==&#62;  value

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When we evaluate the same expression again, we only have to repeat step 2.
What we're doing is akin to memoization, in that we remember the result
of a computation to avoid having to repeat it.  The difference is that
now we're remembering something that's only part of the solution to the
overall problem, instead of a complete solution.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We can duplicate the effect of the original <tt>eval</tt> this way:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (eval exp env)
  ((analyze exp) env))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>The Implementation Details</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>Analyze</tt> has a structure similar to that of the original eval:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (eval exp env)                (define (analyze exp)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp)         (cond ((self-evaluating? exp)
         exp)                                  (analyze-self-eval exp))
        ((variable? exp)                      ((variable? exp)
         (lookup-var-val exp env))             (analyze-var exp))
        ...                                   ...
        ((foo? exp) (eval-foo exp env))       ((foo? exp) (analyze-foo exp))
        ...))                                 ...))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The difference is that the procedures such as <tt>eval-if</tt> that take
an expression and an environment as arguments have been replaced by
procedures such as <tt>analyze-if</tt> that take only the expression as argument.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How do these analysis procedures work?  As an intermediate step in our
understanding, here is a version of <tt>analyze-if</tt> that exactly follows
the structure of <tt>eval-if</tt> and doesn't save any time:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (eval-if exp env)
  (if (true? (eval (if-predicate exp) env))
      (eval (if-consequent exp) env)
      (eval (if-alternative exp) env)))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (analyze-if exp)
  (lambda (env)
    (if (true? (eval (if-predicate exp) env))
	(eval (if-consequent exp) env)
	(eval (if-alternative exp) env))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This version of <tt>analyze-if</tt> returns a procedure with <tt>env</tt> as its
argument, whose body is exactly the same as the body of the original
<tt>eval-if</tt>.  Therefore, if we do

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>((analyze-if some-if-expression) some-environment)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
the result will be the same as if we'd said

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(eval-if some-if-expression some-environment)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
in the original metacircular evaluator.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But we'd like to improve on this first version of <tt>analyze-if</tt> because
it doesn't really avoid any work.  Each time we call the procedure that
<tt>analyze-if</tt> returns, it will do all of the work that the original
<tt>eval-if</tt> did.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The first version of <tt>analyze-if</tt> contains three calls to <tt>eval</tt>.
Each of those calls does an analysis of an expression and then a
computation of the value in the given environment.  What we'd like to
do is split each of those <tt>eval</tt> calls into its two separate parts,
and do the first part only once, not every time:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (analyze-if exp)
  (let ((pproc (analyze (if-predicate exp)))
	(cproc (analyze (if-consequent exp)))
	(aproc (analyze (if-alternative exp))))
    (lambda (env)
      (if (true? (pproc env))
	  (cproc env)
	  (aproc env)))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In this final version, the procedure returned by <tt>analyze-if</tt>
doesn't contain any analysis steps.  All of the components were
already analyzed before we call that procedure, so no further
analysis is needed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The biggest gain in efficiency comes from the way in which <tt>lambda</tt>
expressions are handled.  In the original metacircular evaluator,
leaving out some of the data abstraction for clarity here, we have

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (eval-lambda exp env)
  (list 'procedure exp env))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The evaluator does essentially nothing for a <tt>lambda</tt> expression
except to remember the procedure's text and the environment in which
it was created.  But in the analyzing evaluator we analyze the body
of the procedure; what is stored as the representation of the procedure
does not include its text!  Instead, the evaluator represents a procedure
in the metacircular Scheme as a procedure in the underlying Scheme,
along with the formal parameters and the defining environment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Level Confusion</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The analyzing evaluator turns an expression such as

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(if A B C)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
into a procedure

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(lambda (env)
  (if (A-execution-procedure env)
      (B-execution-procedure env)
      (C-execution-procedure env)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This may seem like a step backward; we're trying to implement <tt>if</tt>
and we end up with a procedure that does an <tt>if</tt>.  Isn't this
an infinite regress?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
No, it isn't.  The <tt>if</tt> in the execution procedure is handled by the
underlying Scheme, not by the metacircular Scheme.  Therefore, there's no
regress; we don't call <tt>analyze-if</tt> for that one.  Also, the <tt>if</tt> in
the underlying Scheme is much faster than having to do the syntactic
analysis for the <tt>if</tt> in the meta-Scheme.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>So What?</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The syntactic analysis of expressions is a large part of what a compiler
does.  In a sense, this analyzing evaluator is a compiler!  It compiles
Scheme into Scheme, so it's not a very useful compiler, but it's really
not that much harder to compile into something else, such as the machine
language of a particular computer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A compiler whose structure is similar to this one is called a <i>recursive
descent </i> compiler.  Today, in practice, most compilers use a different
technique (called a stack machine) because it's possible to automate the
writing of a parser that way.  (I mentioned this earlier as an example of
data-directed programming.)  But if you're writing a parser by hand, it's
easiest to use recursive descent.
