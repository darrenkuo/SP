Because of this, never mind for now the stuff about iterative versus
recursive processes in 1.3 and in the exercises from that section.

these exercises later in the semester.)

2.  Last week you wrote procedures <tt>squares</tt>, that squared each number
in its argument sentence, and saw <tt>pigl-sent</tt>, that <tt>pigl</tt>ed each word
in its argument sentence.  Generalize this pattern to create a higher-order
procedure called <tt>every</tt> that applies an <i>arbitrary </i> procedure,
given as an argument,
to each word of an argument sentence.
This procedure is used as follows:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (every square '(1 2 3 4))
(1 4 9 16)
&#62; (every first '(nowhere man))
(n m)
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
3.  Our Scheme library provides versions of the <tt>every</tt> function from
the last exercise and the <tt>keep</tt> function shown in lecture.  Get
familiar with these by trying examples such as the following:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>(every (lambda (letter) (word letter letter)) 'purple)
(every (lambda (number) (if (even? number) (word number number) number))
       '(781 5 76 909 24))
(keep even? '(781 5 76 909 24))
(keep (lambda (letter) (member? letter 'aeiou)) 'bookkeeper)
(keep (lambda (letter) (member? letter 'aeiou)) 'syzygy)
(keep (lambda (letter) (member? letter 'aeiou)) '(purple syzygy))
(keep (lambda (wd) (member? 'e wd)) '(purple syzygy))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 

<b>Extra for experts:</b> 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
In principle, we could build a version of Scheme with no primitives except
<tt>lambda</tt>.  Everything else can be defined in terms of <tt>lambda</tt>,
although it's
not done that way in practice because it would be so painful.  But we can
get a sense of the flavor of such a language by eliminating one feature at
a time from Scheme to see how to work around it.
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
In this problem we explore a Scheme without <tt>define</tt>.  We can give things
names by using argument binding, as <tt>let</tt> does, so instead of
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>(define (sumsq a b)
  (define (square x) (* x x))
  (+ (square a) (square b)))
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(sumsq 3 4)
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
we can say
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>((lambda (a b)
   ((lambda (square)
      (+ (square a) (square b)))
    (lambda (x) (* x x))))
 3 4)
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
This works fine as long as we don't want to use <i>recursive </i> procedures.
But we can't replace
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>(define (fact n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(fact 5)
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
by
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>((lambda (n)
   (if ...))
 5)
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
because what do we do about the invocation of <tt>fact</tt> inside the body?
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
Your task is to find a way to express the <tt>fact</tt> procedure in a Scheme
without any way to define global names.
