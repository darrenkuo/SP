<div class="p"><!----></div>
This week's big idea is <i>logic programming </i> or <i>declarative
programming</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's the biggest step we've taken away from expressing a computation in
hardware terms.  When we discovered streams, we saw how to express an
algorithm in a way that's independent of the <i>order </i> of evaluation.
Now we are going to describe a computation in a way that has no (visible)
algorithm at all!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We are using a logic programming language that A&amp;S implemented in Scheme.
Because of that, the notation is Scheme-like, i.e., full of lists.  Standard
logic languages like Prolog have somewhat different notations, but the idea
is the same.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All we do is assert facts:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (load "&#126;cs61a/lib/query.scm")
&#62; (query)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
;;; Query input:
(assert! (Brian likes potstickers))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
and ask questions about the facts:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;; Query input:
(?who likes potstickers)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
;;; Query results:
(BRIAN LIKES POTSTICKERS)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Although the assertions and the queries take the form of lists, and so they
look a little like Scheme programs, they're not!  There is no application of
function to argument here; an assertion is just data.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is true even though, for various reasons, it's traditional to put the
verb (the <i>relation </i>) first:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(assert! (likes Brian potstickers))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We'll use that convention hereafter, but that makes it even easier to fall
into the trap of thinking there is a <i>function </i> called <tt>likes</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> Rules.  As long as we just tell the system isolated facts, we
can't get extraordinarily interesting replies.  But we can also tell it <i>
rules </i> that allow it to infer one fact from another.  For example, if we
have a lot of facts like

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(mother Eve Cain)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
then we can establish a rule about grandmotherhood:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(assert! (rule (grandmother ?elder ?younger)
               (and (mother ?elder ?mom)
                    (mother ?mom ?younger) )))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The rule says that the first part (the conclusion) is true <i>if </i> we can
find values for the variables such that the second part (the condition) is
true.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Again, resist the temptation to try to do composition of functions!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(assert! (rule (grandmother ?elder ?younger)         ;; WRONG!!!!
               (mother ?elder (mother ?younger)) ))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>Mother</tt> isn't a function, and you can't ask for the mother of someone
as this incorrect example tries to do.  Instead, as in the correct version
above, you have to establish a variable (<tt>?mom</tt>) that has a value that
satisfies the two motherhood relationships we need.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In this language the words <tt>assert!</tt>, <tt>rule</tt>, <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>,
and <tt>not</tt> have special meanings.  Everything else is just a word that
can be part of assertions or rules.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once we have the idea of rules, we can do real magic:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/4.4/logic-utility.scm
(assert! (rule (append (?u . ?v) ?y (?u . ?z))
               (append ?v ?y ?z)))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(assert! (rule (append () ?y ?y)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(The actual online file uses a Scheme procedure <tt>aa</tt> to add the
assertion.  It's just like saying <tt>assert!</tt>&nbsp;to the query system, but
you say it to Scheme instead.  This lets you <tt>load</tt> the file.  Don't get
confused about this small detail-just ignore it.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;; Query input:
(append (a b) (c d e) ?what)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
;;; Query results:
(APPEND (A B) (C D E) (A B C D E))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So far this is just like what we could do in Scheme.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;; Query input:
(append ?what (d e) (a b c d e))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
;;; Query results:
(APPEND (A B C) (D E) (A B C D E))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
;;; Query input:
(append (a) ?what (a b c d e))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
;;; Query results:
(APPEND (A) (B C D E) (A B C D E))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The new thing in logic programming is that we can run a "function"
backwards!  We can tell it the answer and get back the question.  But the
real magic is...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;; Query input:
(append ?this ?that (a b c d e))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
;;; Query results:
(APPEND () (A B C D E) (A B C D E))
(APPEND (A) (B C D E) (A B C D E))
(APPEND (A B) (C D E) (A B C D E))
(APPEND (A B C) (D E) (A B C D E))
(APPEND (A B C D) (E) (A B C D E))
(APPEND (A B C D E) () (A B C D E))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We can use logic programming to compute multiple answers to the same
question!  Somehow it found all the possible combinations of values that
would make our query true.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How does the <tt>append</tt> program work?  Compare it to the Scheme <tt>
append</tt>:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (append a b)
  (if (null? a)
      b
      (cons (car a) (append (cdr a) b)) ))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Like the Scheme program, the logic program has two cases:  There is a base
case in which the first argument is empty.  In that case the combined list
is the same as the second appended list.  And there is a recursive case in
which we divide the first appended list into its <tt>car</tt> and its <tt>
cdr</tt>. We reduce the given problem into a problem about appending <tt>
(cdr&nbsp;a)</tt> to <tt>b</tt>.  The logic program is different in form, but it says
the same thing.  (Just as, in the grandmother example, we had to give the
mother a name instead of using a function call, here we have to give <tt>
(car&nbsp;a)</tt> a name-we call it <tt>?u</tt>.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Unfortunately, this "working backwards" magic doesn't always work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/4.4/reverse.scm
(assert! (rule (reverse (?a . ?x) ?y)
               (and (reverse ?x ?z)
                    (append ?z (?a) ?y) )))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(assert! (reverse () ()))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This works for <tt>(reverse (a b c) ?what)</tt> but not the other way around;
it gets into an infinite loop.  We can also write a version that works <i>
only </i> backwards:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/4.4/reverse.scm
(assert! (rule (backward (?a . ?x) ?y)
               (and (append ?z (?a) ?y)
                    (backward ?x ?z) )))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(assert! (backward () ()))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But it's much harder to write one that works both ways.  Even as we speak, logic
programming fans are trying to push the limits of the idea, but right now,
you still have to understand something about the below-the-line algorithm to
be confident that your logic program won't loop.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> Below-the-line implementation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Think about <tt>eval</tt> in the MC evaluator.  It takes two arguments, an
expression and an environment, and it returns the value of the expression.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In logic programming, there's no such thing as "the value of the
expression." What we're given is a query, and there may or may not be some
number of variable bindings that make the query true.  The query evaluator
<tt>qeval</tt> is analogous to <tt>eval</tt> in that it takes two arguments,
something to evaluate and a context in which to work.  But the thing to
evaluate is a query, not an expression; the context isn't just one
environment but a whole collection of environments-one for each set of
variable values that satisfy some previous query.  And the result returned
by <tt>qeval</tt> isn't a value.  It's a new collection of environments!  It's
as if <tt>eval</tt> returned an environment instead of a value.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><a href="note-figs/15-1.eps">Figure</a>

</td></tr></table><!--vbox-->
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The "collection" of environments we're talking about here is represented
as a stream.  That's because there might be infinitely many of them!  We use
the stream idea to reorder the computation; what really happens is that we
take one potential set of satisfying values and work it all the way through;
then we try another potential set of values.  But the program looks as if we
compute all the satisfying values at once for each stage of a query.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just as every top-level Scheme expression is evaluated in the global
environment, every top-level query is evaluated in a stream containing a
single empty environment.  (No variables have been assigned values yet.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If we have a query like <tt>(and&nbsp;p&nbsp;q)</tt>, what happens is that we recursively
use <tt>qeval</tt> to evaluate <tt>p</tt> in the empty-environment stream.  The
result is a stream of variable bindings that satisfy <tt>p</tt>.  Then we use
<tt>qeval</tt> to evaluate <tt>q</tt> in that result stream!  The final result is a
stream of bindings that satisfy <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt> simultaneously.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the query is <tt>(or&nbsp;p&nbsp;q)</tt> then we use <tt>qeval</tt> to evaluate each of the
pieces independently, starting in both cases with the empty-environment
stream.  Then we <i>merge </i> the two result streams to get a stream of
bindings that satisfy either <tt>p</tt> or <tt>q</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><a href="note-figs/15-2.eps">Figure</a>

</td></tr></table><!--vbox-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the query is <tt>(not&nbsp;q)</tt>, we can't make sense of that unless we already
have a stream of environments to work with.  That's why we can only use <tt>
not</tt> in a context such as <tt>(and&nbsp;p&nbsp;(not&nbsp;q))</tt>.  We take the stream of
environments that we already have, and we <tt>stream-filter</tt> that stream, using as
the test predicate the function

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(lambda (env) (stream-null? (qeval q env)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That is, we keep only those environments for which we <i>can't </i> satisfy
<tt>q</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<table border="0"><tr><td><a href="note-figs/15-3.eps">Figure</a>

</td></tr></table><!--vbox-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That explains how <tt>qeval</tt> reduces compound queries to simple ones. How
do we evaluate a simple query?  The first step is to <i>pattern match </i>
the query against every assertion in the data base.  Pattern matching is
just like the recursive <tt>equal?</tt>&nbsp;function, except that a variable in
the pattern (the query) matches anything in the assertion.  (But if the same
variable appears more than once, it must match the same thing each time.
That's why we need to keep an environment of matches so far.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The next step is to match the query against the <i>conclusions </i> of
rules. This is tricky because now there can be variables in both things
being matched.  Instead of the simple pattern matching we have to use a more
complicated version called <i>unification</i>.  (See the details in the text.)
If we find a match, then we take the condition part of the rule (the body)
and use that as a new query, to be satisfied within the environment(s) that
<tt>qeval</tt> gave us when we matched the conclusion.  In other words, first
we look at the conclusion to see whether this rule can possibly be relevant
to our query; if so, we see if the conditions of the rule are true.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here's an example, partly traced:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;; Query input:
(append ?a ?b (aa bb))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(unify-match (append ?a ?b (aa bb))         ; MATCH ORIGINAL QUERY
             (append () ?1y ?1y)            ; AGAINST BASE CASE RULE
             ())                            ; WITH NO CONSTRAINTS

<div class="p"><!----></div>
RETURNS: ((?1y . (aa bb)) (?b . ?1y) (?a . ()))
PRINTS:  (append () (aa bb) (aa bb))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since the base-case rule has no body, once we've matched it, we can
print a successful result.  (Before printing, we have to look up variables
in the environment so what we print is variable-free.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now we unify the original query against the conclusion of the other rule:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(unify-match (append ?a ?b (aa bb))                ; MATCH ORIGINAL QUERY
             (append (?2u . ?2v) ?2y (?2u . ?2z))  ; AGAINST RECURSIVE RULE
             ())                                   ; WITH NO CONSTRAINTS

<div class="p"><!----></div>
RETURNS: ((?2z . (bb)) (?2u . aa) (?b . ?2y) (?a . (?2u . ?2v)))
         [call it F1]

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This was successful, but we're not ready to print anything yet, because we
now have to take the body of that rule as a new query.  Note the indenting
to indicate that this call to <tt>unify-match</tt> is within the pending rule.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>    (unify-match (append ?2v ?2y ?2z)   ; MATCH BODY OF RECURSIVE RULE
                 (append () ?3y ?3y)    ; AGAINST BASE CASE RULE
                 F1)                    ; WITH CONSTRAINTS FROM F1

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    RETURNS: ((?3y . (bb)) (?2y . ?3y) (?2v . ()) [plus F1])
    PRINTS:  (append (aa) (bb) (aa bb))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    (unify-match (append ?2v ?2y ?2z)                  ; MATCH SAME BODY
                 (append (?4u . ?4v) ?4y (?4u . ?4z))  ; AGAINST RECURSIVE RULE
                 F1)                                   ; WITH F1 CONSTRAINTS

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    RETURNS: ((?4z . ()) (?4u . bb) (?2y . ?4y) (?2v . (?4u . ?4v))
              [plus F1])  [call it F2]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
        (unify-match (append ?4v ?4y ?4z)   ; MATCH BODY FROM NEWFOUND MATCH
                     (append () ?5y ?5y)    ; AGAINST BASE CASE RULE
                     F2)                    ; WITH NEWFOUND CONSTRAINTS

<div class="p"><!----></div>
        RETURNS: ((?5y . ()) (?4y . ?5y) (?4v . ()) [plus F2])
        PRINTS:  (append (aa bb) () (aa bb))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
        (unify-match (append ?4v ?4y ?4z)                  ; MATCH SAME BODY
                     (append (?6u . ?6v) ?6y (?6u . ?6z))  ; AGAINST RECUR RULE
                     F2)                                   ; SAME CONSTRAINTS

<div class="p"><!----></div>
        RETURNS: ()                                        ; BUT THIS FAILS
