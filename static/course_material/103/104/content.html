We're going to investigate SICP's Scheme interpreter written in Scheme.  This
interpreter implements the environment model of evaluation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here's a reminder of the reasons I mentioned in week 6 for studying a
Scheme interpreter in Scheme, even though it's obviously not something
you'd use in practice:

</dd>
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>It illustrates a big idea:&nbsp;<i>universality</i>.
</dd></dl>
Universality means we can write <i>one program </i> that's equivalent to all
other programs.  At the hardware level, this is the idea that made
general-purpose computers possible.  It used to be that they built a
separate machine, from scratch, for every new problem.  An intermediate
stage was a machine that had a <i>patchboard </i> so you could rewire it,
effectively changing it into a different machine for each problem, without
having to re-manufacture it.  The final step was a single machine that
accepted a program <i>as data </i> so that it can do any problem without
rewiring.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Instead of a function machine that computes a particular function, taking
(say) a number in the input hopper and returning another number out the
bottom, we have a <i>universal </i> function machine that takes <i>a
function machine </i> in one input hopper, and a number in a second hopper,
and returns whatever number the input machine would have returned.  This is
the ultimate in data-directed programming.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Our Scheme interpreter leaves out some of the important components of a real
one.  It gets away with this by taking advantage of the capabilities of the
underlying Scheme.  Specifically, we don't deal with storage allocation,
tail recursion elimination, or implementing any of the Scheme primitives.
All we <i>do </i> deal with is the evaluation of expressions.  That turns
out to be quite a lot in itself, and pretty interesting.

Here is a one-screenful version of the metacircular evaluator with most of
the details left out.  You might want to compare it to the one-screenful
substitution-model interpreter you saw in week 6.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/4.1/micro.scm
(define (scheme)
  (display &#187; ")
  (print (eval (read) the-global-environment))
  (scheme) )

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (eval exp env)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) exp)
        ((symbol? exp) (lookup-in-env exp env))
        ((special-form? exp) (do-special-form exp env))
        (else (apply (eval (car exp) env)
                     (map (lambda (e) (eval e env)) (cdr exp)) ))))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (apply proc args)
  (if (primitive? proc)
      (do-magic proc args)
      (eval (body proc)
            (extend-environment (formals proc)
                                args
                                (proc-env proc) ))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Although the version in the book is a lot bigger, this really does capture
the essential structure, namely, a mutual recursion between <tt>eval</tt>
(evaluate an expression relative to an environment) and <tt>apply</tt> (apply a
function to arguments).  To evaluate a compound expression means to evaluate
the subexpressions recursively, then apply the <tt>car</tt> (a function) to the
<tt>cdr</tt> (the arguments).  To apply a function to arguments means to
evaluate the body of the function in a new environment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What's left out?  Primitives, special forms, and a lot of details.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In that other college down the peninsula, they wouldn't consider you ready
for an interpreter until junior or senior year.  At this point in the
introductory course, they'd still be teaching you where the semicolons go.
How do we get away with this?  We have two big advantages:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>
The <i>source language </i> (the language that we're interpreting) is
simple and uniform.  Its entire formal syntax can be described in one page,
as we did in week 7.  There's hardly anything to implement!
</dd>
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>The <i>implementation language </i> (the one in which the interpreter
itself is written) is powerful enough to handle a program as data, and to
let us construct data structures that are both hierarchical and circular.
</dd></dl>
The amazing thing is that the simple source language and the powerful
implementation language are both Scheme!  You might think that a powerful
language has to be complicated, but it's not so.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> Introduction to Logo.  For the programming project you're turning
the metacircular evaluator into an interpreter for a <i>different </i>
language, Logo.  To do that you should know a little about Logo itself.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Logo is a dialect of Lisp, just as Scheme is, but its design has different
priorities.  The goal was to make it as natural-seeming as possible for
kids. That means things like getting rid of all those parentheses, and that
has other syntactic implications.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(To demonstrate Logo, run <tt>&#126;cs61a/logo</tt> which is Berkeley Logo.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Commands and operations:  In Scheme, every procedure returns a value, even
the ones for which the value is unspecified and/or useless, like <tt>
define</tt> and <tt>print</tt>.  In Logo, procedures are divided into operations,
which return values, and commands, which don't return values but are called
for their effect.  You have to start each instruction with a command:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>print sum 2 3

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Syntax:  If parentheses aren't used to delimit function calls, how do you
know the difference between a function and an argument?  When a symbol is
used without punctuation, that means a function call.  When you want the
value of a variable to use as an argument, you put colon in front of it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>make "x 14
print :x
print sum :x :x

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Words are quoted just as in Scheme, except that the double-quote character
is used instead of single-quote.  But since expressions aren't represented
as lists, the same punctuation that delimits a list also quotes it:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>print [a b c]

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(Parentheses <i>can </i> be used, as in Scheme, if you want to give extra
arguments to something, or indicate infix precedence.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>print (sum 2 3 4 5)
print 3*(4+5)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
No special forms:  Except <tt>to</tt>, the thing that defines a new procedure,
all Logo primitives evaluate their arguments.  How is this possible?  We
"proved" back in chapter 1 that <tt>if</tt> has to be a special form.  But
instead we just quote the arguments to <tt>ifelse</tt>:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>ifelse 2=3 [print "hi] [print "bye]

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You don't notice the quoting since you get it for free with the list
grouping.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Functions not first class:  In Logo every function has a name; there's no
<tt>lambda</tt>.  Also, the namespace for functions is separate from the one
for variables; a variable can't have a function as its value.  (This is
convenient because we can use things like <tt>list</tt> or <tt>sentence</tt> as
formal parameters without losing the functions by those names.)  That's
another reason why you need colons for variables.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So how do you write higher-order functions like <tt>map</tt>?  Two answers.
First, you can use the <i>name </i> of a function as an argument, and you
can use that name to construct an expression and eval it with <tt>run</tt>.
Second, Logo has first-class <i>expressions </i>; you can <tt>run</tt> a list
that you get as an argument.  (This raises issues about the scope of
variables that we'll explore later this week.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>print map "first [the rain in spain]
print map [? * ?] [3 4 5 6]

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> Data abstraction in the evaluator.  Here is a quote from the
Instructor's Manual, regarding section 4.1.2:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Point out that this section is boring (as is much of section 4.1.3), and
explain why:  Writing the selectors, constructors, and predicates that
implement a representation is often uninteresting.  It is important to say
explicitly what you expect to be boring and what you expect to be
interesting so that students don't ascribe their boredom to the wrong aspect
of the material and reject the interesting ideas.  For example, data
abstraction isn't boring, although writing selectors is.  The details of
representing expressions (as given in section 4.1.2) and environments (as
given in section 4.1.3) are mostly boring, but the evaluator certainly
isn't."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I actually think they go overboard by having a separate ADT for every kind
of homogeneous sequence.  For example, instead of <tt>first-operand</tt> and
<tt>rest-operands</tt> I'd just use <tt>first</tt> and <tt>rest</tt> for all
sequences.  But things like <tt>operator</tt> and <tt>operands</tt> make sense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> Dynamic scope.
Logo uses dynamic scope, which we discussed in Section 3.2, instead
of Scheme's lexical scope.  There are advantages and disadvantages to both
approaches.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Summary of arguments for lexical scope:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>
Allows local state variables (OOP).
</dd>
 <dt>

<dd>Prevents name "capture" bugs.
</dd>

</dd></dl>
Summary of arguments for dynamic scope:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>
Allows first-class expressions (WHILE).
</dd>
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>Easier debugging.
</dd>
 <dt>
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt>
<dd>Allows "semi-global" variables.
</dd></dl>
Lexical scope is required in order to make possible Scheme's approach to
local state variables.  That is, a procedure that has a local state variable
must be defined within the scope where that variable is created, and must
carry that scope around with it.  That's exactly what lexical scope
accomplishes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the other hand, (1) most lexically scoped languages (e.g., Pascal) don't
have <tt>lambda</tt>, and so they can't give you local state variables despite
their lexical scope.  And (2) lexical scope is needed for local state
variables only if you want to implement the latter in the particular way
that we've used.  Object Logo, for example, provides OOP without relying on
<tt>lambda</tt> because it includes local state variables as a primitive
feature.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Almost all computer scientists these days hate dynamic scope, and the reason
they give is the one about name captures.  That is, suppose we write
procedure P that refers to a global variable V.  Example:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (area rad)
  (* pi rad rad))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is intended as a reference to a global variable <tt>pi</tt> whose value,
presumably, is 3.141592654.  But suppose we invoke it from within another
procedure like this:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (mess-up pi)
  (area (+ pi 5)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If we say <tt>(mess-up&nbsp;4)</tt> we intend to find the area of a circle with
radius 9.  But we won't get the right area if we're using dynamic scope,
because the name <tt>pi</tt> in procedure <tt>area</tt> suddenly refers to the
local variable in <tt>mess-up</tt>, rather than to the intended global value.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This argument about naming bugs is particularly compelling to people who
envision a programming project in which 5000 programmers work on tiny
slivers of the project, so that nobody knows what anyone else is doing.
In such a situation it's entirely likely that two programmers will happen to
use the same name for different purposes.  But note that we had to do
something pretty foolish-using the name <tt>pi</tt> for something that isn't
<font face="symbol">p</font
> at all-in order to get in trouble.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lexical scope lets you write compilers that produce faster executable
programs, because with lexical scope you can figure out during compilation
exactly where in memory any particular variable reference will be.  With
dynamic scope you have to defer the name-location correspondence until the
program actually runs.  This is the real reason why people prefer lexical
scope, despite whatever they say about high principles.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As an argument for dynamic scope, consider this Logo implementation of the
<tt>while</tt> control structure:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>to while :condition :action
if not run :condition [stop]
run :action
while :condition :action
end

<div class="p"><!----></div>
to example :x
while [:x &#62; 0] [print :x make "x :x-1]
end

<div class="p"><!----></div>
? example 3
3
2
1

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This wouldn't work with lexical scope, because within the procedure <tt>
while</tt> we couldn't evaluate the argument expressions, because the variable
<tt>x</tt> is not bound in any environment lexically surrounding <tt>while</tt>.
Dynamic scope makes the local variables of <tt>example</tt> available to <tt>
while</tt>.  That in turn allows first-class expressions.  (That's what Logo
uses in place of first-class functions.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are ways to get around this limitation of lexical scope.  If you
wanted to write <tt>while</tt> in Scheme, basically, you'd have to make it a
special form that turns into something using thunks.  That is, you'd have
to make

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(while cond act)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
turn into

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(while-helper (lambda () cond) (lambda () act))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But the Logo point of view
is that it's easier for a beginning programmer to understand first-class
expressions than to understand special forms and thunks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Most Scheme implementations include a debugger that allows you to examine
the values of variables after an error.  But, because of the complexity of
the scope rules, the debugging language isn't Scheme itself.  Instead you
have to use a special language with commands like "switch to the
environment of the procedure that called this one." In Logo, when an error
happens you can <i>pause </i> your program and type ordinary Logo
expressions in an environment in which all the relevant variables are
available.  For example, here is a Logo program:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/4.1/bug.logo
to assq :thing :list
if equalp :thing first first :list [op last first :list]
op assq :thing bf :list
end

<div class="p"><!----></div>
to spell :card
pr (se assq bl :card :ranks &#246;f assq last :card :suits)
end

<div class="p"><!----></div>
to hand :cards
if emptyp :cards [stop]
spell first :cards
hand bf :cards
end

<div class="p"><!----></div>
make "ranks [[a ace] [2 two] [3 three] [4 four] [5 five] [6 six] [7 seven]
             [8 eight] [9 nine] [10 ten] [j jack] [q queen] [k king]]
make &#223;uits [[h hearts] [s spades] [d diamonds] [c clubs]]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
? hand [10h 2d 3s]
TEN OF HEARTS
TWO OF DIAMONDS
THREE OF SPADES

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Suppose we introduce an error into <tt>hand</tt> by changing the recursive call
to

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>hand first bf :cards

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The result will be an error message in <tt>assq</tt>-two procedure calls
down-complaining about an empty argument to <tt>first</tt>.  Although the
error is caught in <tt>assq</tt>, the real problem is in <tt>hand</tt>.  In Logo
we can say <tt>pons</tt>, which stands for "print out names," which means to
show the values of <i>all </i> variables accessible at the moment of the
error.  This will include the variable <tt>cards</tt>, so we'll see that the
value of that variable is a single card instead of a list of cards.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Finally, dynamic scope is useful for allowing "semi-global" variables.
Take the metacircular evaluator as an example.  Lots of procedures in it
require <tt>env</tt> as an argument, but there's nothing special about the
value of <tt>env</tt> in any one of those procedures.  It's almost always just
the current environment, whatever that happens to be.  If Scheme had dynamic
scope, <tt>env</tt> could be a parameter of <tt>eval</tt>, and it would then
automatically be available to any subprocedure called, directly or
indirectly, by <tt>eval</tt>.  (This is the flip side of the name-capturing
problem; in this case we <i>want </i> <tt>eval</tt> to capture the name <tt>
env</tt>.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> Environments as circular lists.  When we first saw circular lists
in chapter 2, they probably seemed to be an utterly useless curiosity,
especially since you can't print one.  But in the MC evaluator, every
environment is a circular list, because the environment contains procedures
and each procedure contains a pointer to the environment in which it's
defined.  So, moral number 1 is that circular lists are useful; moral number
2 is not to try to trace a procedure in the evaluator that has an
environment as an argument!  The tracing mechanism will take forever to try
to print the circular argument list.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b><font face="symbol"></font
> Mapreduce part 2</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here's the diagram of mapreduce again:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<a href="mr.eps">Figure</a></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The seemingly unpoetic names <tt>f1</tt> and <tt>f2</tt> serve to remind you of two
things: <tt>f1</tt> (the mapper) is used before <tt>f2</tt> (the reducer), and <tt>
f1</tt> takes one argument while <tt>f2</tt> takes two arguments (just like the
functions used with ordinary <tt>map</tt> and <tt>accumulate</tt> respectively).

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align ="left" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>

<br clear="all" /><b>All data are in the form of key-value pairs.</b> Ordinary <tt>map</tt> doesn't
care what the elements of the data list argument are, but <tt>mapreduce</tt>
works only with data each of which is a key-value pair.  In the Scheme
interface to the distributed filesystem, a file is a stream.  Every element of
the file stream represents one line of the file, using a key-value pair whose
key is the filename and whose value is a list of words, representing the text
of the line.  The <tt>cdr</tt> of a file stream is a promise to ask the
distributed filesystem for the next line.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Each processor runs a separate <tt>stream-map</tt>.</b>  The overlapping squares
at the left of the mapreduce picture represent an entire stream.  (How is a
large distributed file divided among map processes?  It doesn't really matter,
as far as the <tt>mapreduce</tt> user is concerned; <tt>mapreduce</tt> tries to do
it as efficiently as possible given the number of processes and the location
of the data in the filesystem.)  The entire stream is the input to a <tt>map</tt>
process; each element of the stream (a kv-pair) is the input to your mapper
function <tt>f1</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>For each key-value pair in the input stream, the mapper returns a
<u>list</u> of key-value pairs.</b> In the simplest case, each of these lists
will have one element; the code will look something like

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (my-mapper input-kv-pair)
  (list (make-kv-pair ... ...)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The interface requires that you return a list to allow for the non-simplest
cases: (1) Each input key-value pair may give rise to more than one output
key-value pair.  For example, you may want an output key-value pair for each
<i>word </i> of the input file, whereas the input key-value pair represents an
entire line:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (my-mapper input-kv-pair)
  (map (lambda (wd) (make-kv-pair ... ...))
       (kv-value input-kv-pair)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(2) There are <i>three </i> commonly used higher order functions
for sequential data, <tt>map</tt>, <tt>accumulate</tt>/<tt>reduce</tt>, and <tt>
filter</tt>.  The way <tt>mapreduce</tt> handles the sort of problem for which <tt>
filter</tt> would ordinarily be used is to allow a mapper to return an empty list
if this particular key-value pair shouldn't contribute to the result:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (my-mapper input-kv-pair)
  (if ...
      (list input-kv-pair)
      '()))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course it's possible to write mapper functions that combine these three
patterns for more complicated tasks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The keys in the kv-pairs returned by the mapper need not be the same as the
key in the input kv-pair.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Instead of one big accumulation, there's a separate accumulation of
values for each key.</b> The non-parallel computation in the left half of the
picture has two steps, a <tt>map</tt> and an <tt>accumulate</tt>.  But the <tt>
mapreduce</tt> computation has <i>three </i> steps; the middle step sorts all the
key-value pairs produced by all the mapper processes by their keys, and
combines all the kv-pairs with the same key into a single aggregate structure,
which is then used as the input to a <tt>reduce</tt> process.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>This is why the use of key-value pairs is important! </i> If the data had
no such structure imposed on them, there would be no way for us to tell
<tt>mapreduce</tt> which data should be combined in each reduction.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Although it's shown as one big box, the sort is also done in parallel; it's a
"bucket sort," in which each <tt>map</tt> process is responsible for sending
each of its output kv-pairs to the proper <tt>reduce</tt> process.  (Don't be
confused; your mapper function doesn't have to do that.  The <tt>mapreduce</tt>
program takes care of it.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since all the data seen by a single <tt>reduce</tt> process have the same key,
the reducer doesn't deal with keys at all.  This is important because it
allows us to use simple reducer functions such as <tt>+</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, <tt>max</tt>,
etc.  The Scheme interface to <tt>mapreduce</tt> recognizes the special cases of
<tt>cons</tt> and <tt>cons-stream</tt> as reducers and does what you intend, even
though it wouldn't actually work without this special handling, both because
<tt>cons-stream</tt> is a special form and because the iterative implementation
of <tt>mapreduce</tt> would do the combining in the wrong order.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the underlying <tt>mapreduce</tt> software, each <tt>reduce</tt> process leaves
its results in a separate file, stored on the particular processor that ran
the process.  But the Scheme interface to <tt>mapreduce</tt> returns a single
value, a stream that effectively merges the results from all the
<tt>reduce</tt> processes.

<b>Running mapreduce:</b> The <tt>mapreduce</tt> function is not available on the
standard lab machines.  You must connect to the machine that controls the
parallel cluster.  To do this, from the Unix shell you say this:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>ssh icluster1.eecs.berkeley.edu

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you're at home, rather than in the lab, you'll have to provide your class
login to the <tt>ssh</tt> command:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>ssh cs61a-XY@icluster.eecs.berkeley.edu

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
replacing <tt>XY</tt> above with your login account.  <tt>Ssh</tt> will ask for your
password, which is the same on the parallel cluster as for your regular class
account.  Once you are logged into <tt>icluster1</tt>, you can run <tt>stk</tt> as
usual, but <tt>mapreduce</tt> will be available:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(mapreduce mapper reducer reducer-base-case filename-or-special-stream)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The first three arguments are the mapper function for the <tt>map</tt> phase,
and the reducer function and starting value for the <tt>reduce</tt> phase.  The
last argument is the data input to the <tt>map</tt>, but it is restricted to
be either a distributed filesystem folder, which must be one of these:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>"/beatles-songs"         <span class="roman">This one is small and has all Beatles song names</span><!--hbox-->
"/gutenberg/shakespeare" <span class="roman">The collected works of William Shakespeare</span><!--hbox-->
"/gutenberg/dickens"     <span class="roman">The collected works of Charles Dickens</span><!--hbox-->
"/sample-emails"         <span class="roman">Some sample email data for the homework</span><!--hbox-->
"/large-emails"          <span class="roman">A much larger sample email dataset. Use this only</span><!--hbox-->
                         <span class="roman">if you're willing to wait a while.</span><!--hbox-->

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(the quotation marks above are required), or the stream returned by an earlier
call to <tt>mapreduce</tt>.  (Streams you make yourself with <tt>cons-stream</tt>,
etc., can't be used.)  Some problems are solved with two <tt>mapreduce</tt>
passes, like this:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define intermediate-result (mapreduce ...))
(mapreduce ... intermediate-result)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(Yes, you could just use one <tt>mapreduce</tt> call directly as the argument to
the second <tt>mapreduce</tt> call, but in practice you'll want to use
<tt>show-stream</tt> to examine the intermediate result first, to make sure the
first call did what you expect.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here's a sample.  We provide a file of key-value pairs in which the key is
the name of a Beatles album and the value is the name of a song on that album.
Suppose we want to know how many times each word appears in the name of a
song:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (wordcount-mapper document-line-kv-pair)
  (map (lambda (wd-in-line) (make-kv-pair wd-in-line 1))
       (kv-value document-line-kv-pair)))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define wordcounts (mapreduce wordcount-mapper + 0 "/beatles-songs"))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&#62; (ss wordcounts)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The argument to <tt>wordcount-mapper</tt> will be a key-value pair whose key is
an album name, and whose value is a song name.  (In other examples, the key
will be a filename, such as the name of a play by Shakespeare, and the value
will be a line from the play.)  We're interested only in the song names, so
there's no call to <tt>kv-key</tt> in the procedure.  For each song name, we
generate a list of key-value pairs in which the key is a word in the name and
the value is 1.  This may seem silly, having the same value in every pair,
but it means that in the <tt>reduce</tt> stage we can just use <tt>+</tt> as the
reducer, and it'll add up all the occurrences of each word.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You'll find the running time disappointing in this example; since the number
of Beatles songs is pretty small, the same computation could be done faster on
a single machine.  This is because there is a significant setup time both
for <tt>mapreduce</tt> itself and for the <tt>stk</tt> interface.  Since your mapper
and reducer functions have to work when run on parallel machines, your Scheme
environment must be shipped over to each of those machines before the
computation begins, so that bindings are available for any free references in
your procedures.  It's only for large amounts of data (or long computations
that aren't data-driven, such as calculating a trillion digits of <font face="symbol">p</font
>, but
<tt>mapreduce</tt> isn't really appropriate for those examples) that parallelism
pays off.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By the way, if you want to examine the input file, you can't just say

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(ss "/beatles-songs")	; NO

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
because a distributed filename isn't a stream, even though the file itself
is (when viewed by the <tt>stk</tt> interface to <tt>mapreduce</tt>) a stream.
These filenames only work as arguments to <tt>mapreduce</tt> itself.  But we
can use <tt>mapreduce</tt> to examine the file by applying null transformations
in the map and reduce stages:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(ss (mapreduce list cons-stream the-empty-stream "/beatles-songs"))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The mapper function is <tt>list</tt> because the mapper must always return a
list of key-value pairs; in this case, <tt>map</tt> will call <tt>list</tt> with
one argument and so it'll return a list of length one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now we'd like to find the most commonly used word in Beatle song titles.
There are few enough words so that we could really do this on one processor,
but as an exercise in parallelism we'll do it partly in parallel.  The trick
is to have each reduce process find the most common word starting with a
particular letter.  Then we'll have 26 candidates from which to choose the
absolutely most common word on one processor.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (find-max-mapper kv-pair)
  (list (make-kv-pair (first (kv-key kv-pair))
		      kv-pair)))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (find-max-reducer current so-far)
  (if (&#62; (kv-value current) (kv-value so-far))
      current
      so-far))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define frequent (mapreduce find-max-mapper find-max-reducer
			    (make-kv-pair 'foo 0) wordcounts))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&#62; (ss frequent)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&#62; (stream-accumulate find-max-reducer (make-kv-pair 'foo 0)
		     (stream-map kv-value frequent))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a little tricky.  In the <tt>wordcounts</tt> stream, each key-value
pair has a word as the key, and the count for that word as the value:
<tt>(back&nbsp;.&nbsp;3)</tt>.  The mapper transforms this into a key-value pair in
which the key is the first letter of the word, and the value is <i>the
entire input key-value pair </i>: <tt>(b&nbsp;.&nbsp;(back&nbsp;.&nbsp;3))</tt>.  Each <tt>reduce</tt>
process gets all the pairs with a particular key, i.e., all the ones with
the same first letter of the word.  The reducer sees only the values from
those pairs, but each value is itself a key-value pair!  That's why the
reducer has to compare the <tt>kv-value</tt> of its two arguments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As another example, here's a way to count the total number of lines in all
of Shakespeare's plays:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define will (mapreduce (lambda (kv-pair) (list (make-kv-pair 'line 1)))
			+ 0 "/gutenberg/shakespeare"))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For each line in Shakespeare, we make exactly the same pair <tt>(line&nbsp;.&nbsp;1)</tt>.
Then, in the <tt>reduce</tt> stage, all the ones in all those pairs are added.
But this is actually a bad example!  Since all the keys are the same (the
word <tt>line</tt>), only one <tt>reduce</tt> process is run, so the counting isn't
done in parallel.  A better way would be to count each play separately, then
add those results if desired.  You'll do that in lab.
