1.  Modify the <tt>person</tt> class given in the lecture notes for week 7
(it's in the file <tt>demo2.scm</tt> in the <tt>&#126;cs61a/lectures/3.0</tt>
directory) to add a <tt>repeat</tt>
method, which repeats the last thing said.  Here's an example of
responses to the <tt>repeat</tt> message.

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (define brian (instantiate person 'brian))
brian
&#62; (ask brian 'repeat)
()
&#62; (ask brian 'say '(hello))
(hello)
&#62; (ask brian 'repeat)
(hello)
&#62; (ask brian 'greet)
(hello my name is brian)
&#62; (ask brian 'repeat)
(hello my name is brian)
&#62; (ask brian 'ask '(close the door))
(would you please close the door)
&#62; (ask brian 'repeat)
(would you please close the door)

</pre></tt>

<p>
2.  This exercise introduces you to the <tt>usual</tt> procedure
described on page 9 of "Object-oriented Programming - Above-the-line
View".  Read about <tt>usual</tt> there to prepare for lab.

<p>
Suppose that we want to define a class called <tt>double-talker</tt>
to represent people that always say things twice, for example as in
the following dialog.

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (define mike (instantiate double-talker 'mike))
mike
&#62; (ask mike 'say '(hello))
(hello hello)
&#62; (ask mike 'say '(the sky is falling))
(the sky is falling the sky is falling)

</pre></tt>

<p>
Consider the following three definitions for the <tt>double-talker</tt> class.
(They can be found online in the file <tt>&#126;cs61a/lib/double-talker.scm</tt>.)

<p>
<tt>  <pre>(define-class (double-talker name)
  (parent (person name))
  (method (say stuff) (se (usual 'say stuff) (ask self 'repeat))) )

(define-class (double-talker name)
  (parent (person name))
  (method (say stuff) (se stuff stuff)) )

(define-class (double-talker name)
  (parent (person name))
  (method (say stuff) (usual 'say (se stuff stuff))) )

</pre></tt>

<p>
Determine which of these definitions work as intended.
Determine also for which messages the three versions would respond
differently.
