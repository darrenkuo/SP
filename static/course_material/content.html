<P>Welcome to Self-Paced CS 61A, <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</i> (<i>SICP</i>)!

<!-- <P><a href="#menu">Skip to lesson links.</a> -->

<P>There is also a <A HREF="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a">lecture
version</A> of CS 61A with the same name, but making some departures from the
textbook after which the course is named.  This self-paced version has no
formal lectures, although videos of old lectures are optional; it provides
different paths through the course material depending on the prior programming
background of each student.

<P>The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science,
with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's
point of view.
This first course
concentrates mostly on the idea of <i>abstraction</i>, allowing the
programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than
in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
The next course, CS 61B, will deal with the more
advanced engineering aspects of software&mdash;on
constructing and analyzing large programs and on techniques for
handling computationally expensive programs.  Finally, CS 61C concentrates
on machines and how they carry out the programs you write.

<P>The <i>SICP</i> textbook, by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman
with Julie Sussman, is available online
<A HREF="http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">here</A>.

<P>Those students whose prior experience does not include programming recursive
functions, or does not include the Scheme language, or does not include
computer programming at all, will start with excerpts from
<i>Simply Scheme</i>, by Brian Harvey and Matthew Wright, a book written
specifically as a "prequel" to <i>SICP</i>.  The entire book is also
available online
<A HREF="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html">here</A>.

<P>The instructor of this course is
<A HREF="http://cs.berkeley.edu/~bh">Brian Harvey</A>,
<A HREF="mailto:bh@cs.berkeley.edu">bh@cs.berkeley.edu</A>,
781 Soda Hall, 642-8311.  Send email to make an appointment.

<P>For most administrative and intellectual problems, your first point of
contact will be the TA, Darren Kuo, <A
HREF="mailto:cs61as@imail.eecs.berkeley.edu">cs61as@imail.eecs.berkeley.edu</A>, ...

<P>Another resource for intellectual questions is our
<A HREF="http://www.piazzza.com/class/cs61as">online discussion group</A>,
where you can get answers from other students and from the course staff.
Don't post individual administrative questions ("Why did I get 5 points...")
on the discussion group.

<P>If you have a home computer, you may want to get a Scheme interpreter for
it.  The Computer Science Division can provide you with free versions of
Scheme for Linux, Windows, or MacOS.  The distribution also includes the
Scheme library programs that we use in this course.  You can
dowload copies of this distribution
<A HREF="http://inst.EECS.Berkeley.EDU/~scheme">here</A>.

<P>The course is organized into six "units" numbered 0 through 5.
Unit 0 is the introductory material for students whose prior experience
does not include programming recursive functions in Scheme.  Units 1
through 5 correspond to chapters of the <i>SICP</i> textbook.  This is
a <i>variable credit</i> course; you earn one UCB credit unit for each
of course units 1 through 5 that you complete successfully.  This means
that if you work at a slower pace, you can earn, e.g., two units of A
instead of four units of F, and then finish the course next semester.
Units 1 through 3 are the minimum requirement to meet the 61A prerequisite
for later CS courses, but students are very strongly urged to complete
unit 4 also, to have an experience equivalent to the lecture-based 61A.

<P>The online material is organized in terms of "lessons"; for the most part,
one lesson is roughly equivalent to a week in the lecture-based version of
61A.  Lessons are named, e.g., 2.4 for the fourth lesson within unit 2.
Each lesson contains in-class lab activities and homework, mostly taken
from the textbook, for you to do on your own.  After you submit each homework
assignment, you can see our solutions to the week's problems; you should be
sure to read these and compare our solutions to yours to ensure that you
understand the concepts of the lesson.

<P>Each lesson ends with a link to the reading for the following lesson.
<b>Do the reading <i>before</i> you do the next lab!</b>  And then probably
read it again before doing the homework.

<P>The purpose of the homework and lab exercises is for you to learn the
course, not to prove that you already know it.  Therefore, the unit homeworks
are not graded on the correctness of your solutions, but on effort.  <b>You
will get full credit for an entirely wrong answer that shows reasonable
effort!</b> (But you should test your work.  If your solution is incorrect,
the grader will want to see some evidence that you know it's incorrect.)

<P>Each lesson also includes both video and notes from a previous semester
of the lecture-based 61A.  Don't watch the videos in the lab!  You need not
watch them at all, but they're available to you to watch at home.  It's
probably wise at least to read the lecture notes.

<P>Most of the weekly assignments include problems labelled as "Extra for
Experts."  These problems are entirely optional; do them only if you
have finished the regular assignment and want to do something more
challenging.  There is no extra <i>credit</i> for these problems;
people who need more credit shouldn't even be trying them, and people
who are doing well in the course should be motivated by the desire to learn.

<P>After completing each lesson, and reading the online solutions, you should
ask your TA in lab to give you a quiz on the lesson.  The quiz will be
randomly generated from a bank of questions.  A typical quiz will have one
<i>analytic</i> question, in which you are given a program and asked to
describe something about its behavior; one <i>synthetic</i> question, in which
you are asked to write a short computer program; and one <i>expert</i>
question, pushing the limits of what we expect the best students to
accomplish.  You must answer the first two correctly to go on to the next
lesson; if not, you can review the lesson at your own pace and then retake the
quiz (with different questions) until you do pass it.  Answering the first two
questions counts as a B; answering all three correctly is an A.

<P>Different students will progress through the course at different
speeds, and that's fine.  In order to complete units 1&ndash;4 in one
semester, though, you should plan to pace yourself at one lesson per
week.  Students who complete lessons <i>faster</i> than that will be
offered optional lessons, consisting of <i>SICP</i> sections we have
traditionally skipped over in 61A for lack of time, one at the end of
unit 3 and one at the end of unit 4.  Unit 5 (consisting
of chapter 5 of <i>SICP</i>) is similarly optional.  If you complete
four of the six optional lessons, your registration is retroactively
changed to CS 61AH, <i>Honors</i> Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs.

<P>Tutoring services are provided by Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), the EECS honors
society (345 Soda, hkn@hkn), and Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the Computer
Science honors society (346 Soda, upe@cory).
