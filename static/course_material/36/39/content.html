<li> Start the Emacs editor, either by typing emacs in your main window or by selecting it from the alt-middle mouse menu. (Your TA will show you how to do this.) From the Help menu, select the Emacs tutorial. You need not complete the entire tutorial at the first session, but you should do so eventually.</li>

<li>

Start Scheme, either by typing stk in your main window or by typing meta-S in your Emacs window. Type each of the following expressions into Scheme, ending the line with the Enter (carriage return) key. Think about the results! Try to understand how Scheme interprets what you type. <p>

<div id="scheme" style="width:100%; display: table;">

  <ul>

    <div style="float:left; width:25%;">

      (first 'hello)<p> 

      (+ 2 3)<p> 

      (first hello)<p> 

      (+ 5 6 7 8)<p> 

      (first (bf 'hello))<p> 

      (+)<p> 

      (+ (first 23) (last 45))<p> 

      (sqrt 16)<p> 

      (define pi 3.14159)<p> 

      (+ (* 3 4) 5)<p> 

      pi<p> 

      +<p> 

    </div>

    <div style="float: left; width:25%;">

      'pi<p> 

      '+<p> 

      (+ pi 7)<p> 

      'hello<p> 

      (* pi pi)<p> 

      '(+ 2 3)<p> 

      (define (square x) (* x x))<p> 

      '(good morning)<p> 

      (square 5)<p> 

      (first 274)<p> 

      (square (+ 2 3))<p> 

      (butfirst 274)<p> 

    </div>

  </ul>

  </div>

</li>

<li>

Use Emacs to create a file called pigl.scm in your directory containing the Pig Latin program shown below:<p>

###pigl.scm###

<p><p>

Make sure you are editing a while whose name ends in .scm, so that Emacs will know to indent your code correctly!<p> 

</li>

<li>

Now run Scheme. You are going to create a transcript of a session using the file you just created:<br> 

###transcript.scm###

<p><p>

</li>

<li>

Use lpr to print your transcript.<br> 

</li>

<li>
  <p>
  Predict what Scheme will print in response to each of these expressions. Then try it and make sure your<br>answer was correct, or if not, that you understand why!<br>
###6.scm###
</p>
</li>
