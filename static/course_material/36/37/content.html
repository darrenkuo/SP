Welcome to CS 61A, the world's best computer science course, because
we use the world's best CS book as the textbook.  The only thing
wrong with this course is that all the rest of the CS courses for
the rest of your life will seem a little disappointing (and repetitive).
<br/><br/>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
Course overview comes next lecture; now we're going to jump right in
so you can get started exploring on your own in the lab.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In 61A we program in Scheme, which is an <i>interactive </i> language.
That means that instead of writing a great big program and then cranking it
through all at once, you can type in a single expression and find out its
value.  For example:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

</td><td></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->Terminology: the <i>formal parameter </i> is the name of the
argument (<tt>x</tt>); the <i>actual argument expression </i> is
the expression used in the invocation (<tt>(+&nbsp;2&nbsp;3)</tt>); the
<i>actual argument value </i> is the value of the argument in
the invocation (5).  The argument's name comes from the function's
definition; the argument's value comes from the invocation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Examples:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (plural wd)
  (word wd 's))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This simple <tt>plural</tt> works for lots of words (book, computer,
elephant) but not for words that end in <tt>y</tt> (fly, spy).  So we
improve it:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.1/plural.scm
(define (plural wd)
  (if (equal? (last wd) 'y)
      (word (bl wd) 'ies)
      (word wd 's)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>If</tt> is a special form that only evaluates one of the alternatives.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Pig Latin:  Move initial consonants to the end of the word and append
"ay"; SCHEME becomes EMESCHAY.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.1/pigl.scm
(define (pigl wd)
  (if (pl-done? wd)
      (word wd 'ay)
      (pigl (word (bf wd) (first wd)))))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (pl-done? wd)
  (vowel? (first wd)))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (vowel? letter)
  (member? letter '(a e i o u)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>Pigl</tt> demonstrates <i>recursion </i>-a function that invokes
itself.  If this is new to you, maybe you should take CS&nbsp;3 first.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another example:  Remember how to play Buzz?  You go around the circle
counting, but if your number is divisible by 7 or has a digit 7 you
have to say "buzz" instead:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.1/buzz.scm
(define (buzz n)
  (cond ((equal? (remainder n 7) 0) 'buzz)
        ((member? 7 n) 'buzz)
        (else n)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This introduces the <tt>cond</tt> special form for multi-way choices.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>Cond</tt> is the big exception to the rule about the meaning of
parentheses; the clauses aren't invocations.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Course overview:</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Computer science isn't about computers (that's electrical engineering)
and it isn't primarily a science (we invent things more than we
discover them).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CS is partly a form of engineering (concerned with building reliable,
efficient mechanisms, but in software instead of metal) and partly an
art form (using programming as a medium for creative expression).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Programming is really easy, as long as you're solving small problems.
Any kid in junior high school can write programs in BASIC, and not just
exercises, either; kids do quite interesting and useful things with
computers.  But BASIC doesn't scale up; once the problem is so complicated
that you can't keep it all in your head at once, you need help, in the
form of more powerful ways of thinking about programming.  (But in this
course we mostly use small examples, because we'd never get finished
otherwise, so you have to imagine how you think each technique would
work out in a larger case.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We deal with four big programming styles/approaches/paradigms:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<font face="symbol"></font

 <dt>

<dd>Logic programming (1 week)
</dd></dl>
The big idea of the course is <i>abstraction </i>:&nbsp;inventing languages that
let us talk more nearly in a problem's own terms and less in terms of the
computer's mechanisms or capabilities.  There is a hierarchy of abstraction:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>Application programs
High-level language (Scheme)
Low-level language (C)
Machine language
Architecture (registers, memory, arithmetic unit, etc)
circuit elements (gates)
transistors
solid-state physics
quantum mechanics

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In 61C we look at lower levels; all are important but we want to start
at the highest level to get you thinking right.

<br/><br/>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Style of work:</b>  Cooperative learning.  No grading curve, so no need
to compete.  Homework is to learn from; only tests are to test you.  Don't
cheat; ask for help instead.  (This is the <i>first </i> CS course; if
you're tempted to cheat now, how are you planning to get through the harder
ones?)

<br/><br/>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Functions.</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> A function can have any number of arguments, including zero,
but must have exactly one return value.  (Suppose you want two?  You
combine them into one, e.g., in a sentence.)  It's not a function unless
you always get the same answer for the same arguments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> Why does that matter?  If each little computation is independent
of the past history of the overall computation, then we can <i>reorder </i>
the little computations.  In particular, this helps cope with parallel
processors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> The function definition provides a formal parameter (a name),
and the function invocation provides an actual argument (a value).  These
fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.  <i>Don't write a "function"
that only works for one particular argument value!</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<font face="symbol"></font
> Instead of a sequence of events, we have composition of functions,
like f(g(x)) in high school algebra.  We can represent this visually with
function machines and plumbing diagrams.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Recursion:</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.1/argue.scm
&#62; (argue '(i like spinach))
(i hate spinach)
&#62; (argue '(broccoli is awful))
(broccoli is great)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (argue s)
  (if (empty? s)
      '()
      (se (opposite (first s))
          (argue (bf s)))))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (opposite w)
  (cond ((equal? w 'like) 'hate)
        ((equal? w 'hate) 'like)
        ((equal? w 'wonderful) 'terrible)
        ((equal? w 'terrible) 'wonderful)
        ((equal? w 'great) 'awful)
        ((equal? w 'awful) 'great)
        ((equal? w 'terrific) 'yucky)
        ((equal? w 'yucky) 'terrific)
        (else w) ))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This computes a function (the <tt>opposite</tt> function) of each word in a
sentence.  It works by dividing the problem for the whole sentence into
two subproblems:&nbsp;an easy subproblem for the first word of the sentence,
and another subproblem for the rest of the sentence.  This second subproblem
is just like the original problem, but for a smaller sentence.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We can take <tt>pigl</tt> from last lecture and use it to translate a whole
sentence into Pig Latin:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (pigl-sent s)
  (if (empty? s)
      '()
      (se (pigl (first s))
          (pigl-sent (bf s)))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The structure of <tt>pigl-sent</tt> is a lot like that of <tt>argue</tt>.  This
common pattern is called <i>mapping </i> a function over a sentence.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not all recursion follows this pattern.  Each element of Pascal's triangle
is the sum of the two numbers above it:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(define (pascal row col)
  (cond ((= col 0) 1)
        ((= col row) 1)
        (else (+ (pascal (- row 1) (- col 1))
                 (pascal (- row 1) col) ))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Normal vs. applicative order.</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To illustrate this point we use a modified Scheme evaluator that lets
us show the process of applicative or normal order evaluation.  We
define functions using <tt>def</tt> instead of <tt>define</tt>.  Then, we
can evaluate expressions using <tt>(applic&nbsp;(...))</tt> for applicative
order or <tt>(normal&nbsp;(...))</tt> for normal order.  (Never mind how this
modified evaluator itself works!  Just take it on faith and concentrate
on the results that it shows you.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the printed results, something like

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(* 2 3) ==&#62; 6

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
indicates the ultimate invocation of a primitive function.  But

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(f 5 9) --&#62;
(+ (g 5) 9)

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
indicates the substitution of actual arguments into the body of
a function defined with <tt>def</tt>.  (Of course, whether actual argument
values or actual argument expressions are substituted depends on
whether you used <tt>applic</tt> or <tt>normal</tt>, respectively.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (load "lectures/1.1/order.scm")
&#62; (def (f a b) (+ (g a) b))     ; define a function
f
&#62; (def (g x) (* 3 x))           ; another one
g
&#62; (applic (f (+ 2 3) (- 15 6))) ; show applicative-order evaluation

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(f (+ 2 3) (- 15 6))
   (+ 2 3) ==&#62; 5
   (- 15 6) ==&#62; 9
(f 5 9) --&#62; 
(+ (g 5) 9)
   (g 5) --&#62; 
   (* 3 5) ==&#62; 15
(+ 15 9) ==&#62; 24
24
&#62; (normal (f (+ 2 3) (- 15 6))) ; show normal-order evaluation

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(f (+ 2 3) (- 15 6)) --&#62; 
(+ (g (+ 2 3)) (- 15 6))
   (g (+ 2 3)) --&#62; 
   (* 3 (+ 2 3))
      (+ 2 3) ==&#62; 5
   (* 3 5) ==&#62; 15
   (- 15 6) ==&#62; 9
(+ 15 9) ==&#62; 24                 ; Same result, different process.

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(continued on next page)

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (def (zero x) (- x x))        ; This function should always return 0.
zero
&#62; (applic (zero (random 10)))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(zero (random 10))
   (random 10) ==&#62; 5
(zero 5) --&#62; 
(- 5 5) ==&#62; 0
0                               ; Applicative order does return 0.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
&#62; (normal (zero (random 10)))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(zero (random 10)) --&#62; 
(- (random 10) (random 10))
   (random 10) ==&#62; 4
   (random 10) ==&#62; 8
(- 4 8) ==&#62; -4
-4                              ; Normal order doesn't.

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The rule is that if you're doing functional programming, you get the
same answer regardless of order of evaluation.  Why doesn't this hold
for <tt>(zero (random 10))</tt>?  Because it's not a function!  Why not?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Efficiency:  Try computing

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>(square (square (+ 2 3)))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
in normal and applicative order.  Applicative order is more efficient
because it only adds 2 to 3 once, not four times.  (But later in the
semester we'll see that sometimes normal order is more efficient.)

<font face="symbol"></font
> <b>Unix Shell Programming</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>[This topic may be in week 1, week 4, or week 11 depending on the holidays
each semester.]</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sometimes the best way to solve a programming problem is not to write a
program at all, but instead to glue together existing programs that
solve the problem.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As an example, we'll construct a spelling-checker program.  It will take
a text file as input, and will generate a list of words that are in the
file but not in the online dictionary.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For this demonstration I'll use the file named <tt>summary</tt> as the
text I want to spell-check.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We are given a file that contains several words per line, including
things we don't want to compare against the dictionary, such as spaces
and punctuation.  Our job will be easier if we transform the input
into a file with exactly one word per line, with no spaces or
punctuation (except that we'll keep apostrophes, which are part of
words - contractions such as "we'll" - rather than word
delimiters).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>tr -d '.,;:"'134!'134[]()' &lt; summary &#62; nopunct

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>Tr</tt> is a Unix utility program that translates one character into
another.  In this case, because of the <tt>-d</tt> switch, we are asking
it to delete from the input any periods, commas, semicolons, colons,
exclamation points, braces, and parentheses.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The single-quote (<tt>'</tt>) characters are used to tell the shell
that the characters between them should not be interpreted according
to the shell's usual syntax.  For example, a semicolon in a shell
command line separates two distinct commands; the shell does one
and then does the other.  Here we want the semicolon to be passed to
the <tt>tr</tt> program just as if it were a letter of the alphabet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When a program asks to read or print text, without specifying a
particular source or destination, its input comes from something
called the <i>standard input </i>; its output goes to the
<i>standard output.</i>  Ordinarily, the standard input is the
keyboard and the standard output is the screen.  But you can
<i>redirect </i> them using the characters <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&#62;</tt> in
shell commands.  In this case, we are asking the shell to connect
<tt>tr</tt>'s standard input to the file named <tt>summary</tt>, and to
connect its standard output to a new file named <tt>nopunct</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spacing characters in text files include the space character and
the tab character.  To simplify things, let's translate tabs to
spaces.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>tr '    ' ' ' &lt; nopunct &#62; notab

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Between the first pair of single-quotes is a tab character.  <tt>Tr</tt>
will translate every tab in the file to a space.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We really want one word per line, so let's translate spaces to
newline characters.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>tr ' ' ''134n' &lt; notab &#62; oneword

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The notation <tt>'134n</tt> is a standard Unix notation for
the newline character.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In English text, we capitalize the first word of each sentence.
The words in the dictionary aren't capitalized (unless they're
proper nouns).  So let's translate capital letters to lower case:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' &lt; oneword &#62; lowcase

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The notation <tt>[A-Z]</tt> means all the characters between the given
extremes; it's equivalent to

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What <tt>tr</tt> does is convert every instance of the nth character of its
first argument into the nth character of the second argument.  So we are
asking it to convert <tt>A</tt> to <tt>a</tt>, <tt>B</tt> to <tt>b</tt>, and so on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Our plan is to compare each word of the text against the words in
the dictionary.  But we don't have to read every word of the
dictionary for each word of the file; since the dictionary is
sorted alphabetically, if we sort the words in our text file, we
can just make one pass through both files in parallel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>sort &lt; lowcase &#62; sorted

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <tt>sort</tt> program can take arguments to do sorting in many
different ways; for example, you can ask it to sort the lines of
a file based on the third word of each line.  But in this case,
we want the simplest possible sort: The "sort key" is the entire
line, and we're sorting in character-code order (which is the same
as alphabetical order since we eliminated capital letters).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Common words like "the" will occur many times in our text.  There's
no need to spell-check the same word repeatedly.  Since we've sorted
the file, all instances of the same word are next to each other in
the file, so we can ask Unix to eliminate consecutive equal lines:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>uniq &lt; sorted &#62; nodup

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>Uniq</tt> has that name because in its output file every line is
unique; it eliminates (consecutive) duplicates.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now we're ready to compare our file against the dictionary.  This may
seem like a special-purpose operation for which we'll finally have to
write our own program, but in fact what we want to do is a common
database operation, combining entries from two different databases
that have a certain element in common.  Our application is a trivial
one in which each "database" entry has only one element, and we are
just checking for matches.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This combining of databases is called a <i>join </i> in the technical
terminology of database programming.  In our case, what we want is not
the join itself, but rather a report of those elements of one database
(our text file) that don't occur in the other database (the online
dictionary).  This is what the <tt>-v1</tt> switch means:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>join -v1 nodup words &#62; errors

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's it!  We now have a list of misspelled words that we can correct
in Emacs.  The user interface of this spelling program isn't fancy, but
it gets the job done, and we didn't have to work hard to get it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's a little ugly that we've created all these intermediate files.
But we don't have to, because the shell includes a "pipe" feature that
lets you connect the standard output of one program to the standard
input of another.  So we can do it this way:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>tr -d '.,;:"'134!'134[]()'  -  tr '    ' ' '  -  tr ' ' ''134n' '134
 -  tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'  -  sort  -  uniq  -  join -v1 - words

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The backslash at the end of the first line is the shell's <i>continuation </i>
character, telling it that the same command continues on the next line.
The minus sign (<tt>-</tt>) as the second argument to <tt>join</tt> tells it to
take its first database input from its standard input rather than from a
named file.  (This is a standard Unix convention for programs that read
more than one input file.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We can write a file named <tt>spell</tt> containing this command line, mark
the file as executable (a program, rather than data) with the command

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>chmod +x spell

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
and then instead of the sequence of commands I used earlier we can
just say

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>spell &lt; summary &#62; errors

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What we've done is use existing programs, glued together in a "scripting
language" (the Unix shell), to solve a new problem with very little effort.
This is called "code re-use."  The huge collection of Unix utility programs
have been written with this technique in mind; that's why almost all of them
are what the Unix designers call "filters," meaning programs that take a
text stream as input and produce a modified text stream as output.  Each
filter doesn't care where its input and output are; they can be files, or
they can be pipes connected to another filter program.
